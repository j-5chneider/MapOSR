3078	WoS	Cost of free open-access medical education (FOAM): An economic analysis of the top 20 FOAM sites		Background: Free open-access medical education (FOAM) is a growing resource within the field of medicine, in particular, emergency medicine. Yet despite FOAM's contribution to advancing medical education, the precise value of FOAM has never been calculated. As a result, content creators have not been acknowledged, either financially or academically, for their deliverables. The aim of this paper was to meet this challenge by determining a value for the top 20 FOAM sites as determined by web traffic in emergency medicine through two approaches. The first approach was to value the websites through a market-based method, where the value of the website was extrapolated from the number of blog posts published. The second approach was through a traffic analysis for each website. Methods: The top 20 FOAM websites in emergency medicine were identified and the monetary value of each resource was calculated through two methods, the first by extrapolating the number of blog posts published by each resource and the second through traffic analysis conducted by a third-party industry specialist based on the number of unique visitors and page visits. Results: The median page views per month was 194,850 and the median number of unique visitors was 138,350. Based on the content valuation method, the median value of content produced in a year was $2337.06 per website. Through the traffic valuation method, the median overall value of a website was $22,815. Conclusions: Although two different approaches were used to value FOAM, both came to the same conclusion that there is substantial economic value being produced. This value should not go unrewarded and content creators should be acknowledged either academically or financially for their contributions.	10.1002/aet2.10795	Lee, M; Hamilton, D; Chan, TM																					2022.0					10.1002/aet2.10795			44958	a=openeducation	m=other	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3080	WoS	COVID-19 and the scientific publishing system: growth, open access and scientific fields	COVID-19; Scientific publications; Growth of science; Dimensions; Open access	We model the growth of scientific literature related to COVID-19 and forecast the expected growth from 1 June 2021. Considering the significant scientific and financial efforts made by the research community to find solutions to end the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented volume of scientific outputs is being produced. This questions the capacity of scientists, politicians and citizens to maintain infrastructure, digest content and take scientifically informed decisions. A crucial aspect is to make predictions to prepare for such a large corpus of scientific literature. Here we base our predictions on the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothing models using the Dimensions database. This source has the particularity of including in the metadata information on the date in which papers were indexed. We present global predictions, plus predictions in three specific settings: by type of access (Open Access), by domain-specific repository (SSRN and MedRxiv) and by several research fields. We conclude by discussing our findings.	10.1007/s11192-022-04536-x	Nane, GF; Robinson-Garcia, N; van Schalkwyk, F; Torres-Salinas, D																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-022-04536-x			44958	a=openaccess	m=other	d=med; d=hum; d=socscie; d=natscie	t=researcher	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3092	Scopus	Data from “Open Data engages Citation and Reuse: A Follow-up Study on Enhanced Publication”	Attitude Change; Data Citation; Data Reuse; Enhanced Publication	The data collected is based on the responses of forty-four authors/researchers, who have presented full-text papers published in the International Conference Series on Grey Literature2. The dataset consists of responses to ten questions, two of which are openended. Six of the questions are taken from a questionnaire carried out in 2011 within GreyNet’s Enhanced Publications Project. The data contain the number of responses and percentages to each question. The questions deal with the author’s own empirical research data, its availability, the formats in which it appears, and the author’s willingness to archive it and make it openly accessible. Additional questions deal with the respondent’s citation and reference to data, their use of data journals in carrying out search and retrieval, and whether they have (co)authored a data paper or data article. The data was collected via SurveyMonkey3, where it remains stored along with a copy in .ods format in the DANS EASY Archive4. The reuse of the questions and data collected from the study in 2011 is likewise based on the same selection used to define the population of the earlier study. The data collected allows for insight into the changing attitudes and practices within GreyNet’s research community and renders a use case for other research communities. © 2022, GreyNet.

3094	WoS	Data sharing practices in open access mode: a study of the willingness to share data in different disciplines		Introduction. Considering the problems of making research data freely available despite many initiatives and legislation, this study explores the possible differences and similarities of research fields in understanding and enacting open access use and sharing of research data. Method. An online survey was distributed and 671 responses of researchers from Lithuania and Finland were surveyed. Analysis. Chi-squared tests were used to compare proportions across questions groups. Bonferroni corrections applied to p-values were used to reduce the risk of type I errors in the post-hoc analysis of Chi-squared tests. Chi-squared post-hoc tests using adjusted residuals were calculated. Results. Willingness to share research data in open access mode was higher in natural, biomedical and technological sciences than in humanities and social sciences. Although the principle of open research data is supported, there are considerable differences in the character of research data, and the ethical concerns and data management policies between different research fields. Conclusions. Changing culture of data sharing is much harder than publication of new initiatives and legislation. By comparing results with the data from same survey from UK, France, and Turkey we find out that researcher in Finland and Lithuania are more conservative regarding open research data.	10.47989/irpaper932	Enwald, H; Grigas, V; Rudzioniene, J; Kortelainen, T																					2022.0					10.47989/irpaper932			44958	a=opendata	m=survey	d=natscie; d=eng; d=hum; d=med; d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=FIN; geo=LTU; geo=GBR; geo=TUR; geo=FRA		a=opendata	m=survey	d=none	t=none	geo=FIN; geo=LTU							
3095	Scopus	Data sources and their effects on the measurement of open access. Comparing dimensions with the web of science	Accurate measurement; Bibliometric; Data-source; Data-sources; Open Data; Publishing; Web of Science	With the amount of open access (OA) mandates at the funder and institution level growing, the accurate measurement of OA publishing is an important policy question. Existing studies have provided estimates of the prevalence of OA publications ranging from 27.9% to 53.7%, depending on the data source and period of investigation. This paper aims at providing a comparison of the proportion of OA publishing as represented in two bibliometric databases, Web of Science (WoS) and Dimensions, and assess how it affects the measurement of OA across different countries. Results show that publications indexed in Dimensions have a higher percentage of OA than those indexed by the WoS, especially for publications from outside North America and Europe. The paper concludes with a discussion of the cause and consequences of these differences, motivating for the use of more inclusive databases when examining OA, especially for publications beyond North America and Europe. © 2021 18th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2021.

3101	WoS	Determinants of article processing charges for hybrid and gold open access journals	Market power; Article processing charge; Gold open access journal; Hybrid journal; Springer imprint; Subscription journal	Purpose While the number of hybrid journals has increased with the conversion from subscription journals, article processing charges (APCs) have not been examined as frequently as gold open access journals. This study compared the factors affecting APCs for hybrid and gold open access journals by formulating a charge equation. Design/methodology/approach This study examined the APCs for 1,354 hybrid and gold open access journals in the Springer imprint. Using the ordinary least squares method, it investigated the determinants of charges, including the relationship between subscription prices and APCs for hybrid journals. Findings The results revealed that the charges set by hybrid journals were higher than those set by gold open access journals by US$1,620, after controlling for other variables. A reason could be the oligopolistic market structure of the leading publishers. Although the publisher imprint set the APCs based on the journal characteristics, the difference in the determinants of the charges between the two journal types may be due to the business models specific to the journal types. Research limitations/implications The findings suggested that policymakers must consider the market power of leading publishers to establish a healthy scholarly communication market. Originality/value This study examined the relationship between subscription prices and charges for hybrid journals as well as the determinants of charges for both journal types, considering various characteristics of individual journals.	10.1108/IDD-09-2021-0098	Asai, S																					2022.0					10.1108/IDD-09-2021-0098			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3102	Scopus	Developing solutions for open access to the full text of theses/ dissertations of educational and research institutes in Iran		Students as researchers need valuable resources related to their fields such as theses/ dissertations. Open access should be supported by educational and research institutes and faculty members so that information is easily available to scholars, scientists and students. However, some of the educational and research centers refuse to make their theses and dissertations available, and they announce a variety of reasons for this refusal of access. By identifying these reasons, this research tries to eliminate them. For this purpose, first, according to the results of previous researches, a list of factors influencing open access to theses and dissertations were extracted. Then, in order to complete and finalize the mentioned list, the impact of these factors has been investigated using Delphi method and questionnaire tool. In this research, Delphi panel consists of 14 faculty members of educational and research institutes in Tehran who have been selected by purposeful sampling method. The results show that the factors of laws and regulations, social impact, information technology, author’s credibility, observability, perceived awareness, attitude toward open access, self-confidence in knowledge dissemination, controllability, perceptual compatibility and culture have influence on open access to theses and dissertations. © 2021 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

3109	WoS	Diamond Open Access in Norway 2017-2020	Diamond OA; Norway; Gold OA; scholarly publishing	We see from information published elsewhere that Gold OA is on the increase globally. The OA Diamond study indicates that Diamond OA is an important component of scholarly communications, with an estimated 8-9% of the total global scholarly output. These numbers, however, are on a global scale and are not necessarily representative of any given country; country case studies are needed to find this information. Norway is a country where the government has declared a 100% OA goal and most research has public funding. Norway has good financing structures for various models of OA, and it has a national CRIS system. This study tries to find and present numbers for articles in scholarly journals to describe both recent developments and relative numbers for Norway as a whole, and for scholarly fields in Norway, with regards to Diamond OA. Numbers for and development of Gold OA will also be given and commented upon to some extent.	10.3390/publications10010013	Frantsvag, JE																					2022.0					10.3390/publications10010013			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=NOR	method could also be document review	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=NOR

Thus, this study aims to examine digital librarianship practice and open access technology use for sustainable development in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach The survey type of descriptive research design was adopted in this study while the population of the study comprised librarians in universities in Delta State. A total of 38 randomly selected librarians from four universities in Delta State were used for this study, and the data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics. Findings This study revealed that the level of digital librarianship practice in university libraries in Delta State for sustainable development is low; just as social media tools, open source integrated library systems and Google Cloud Platforms are the most commonly used open access technologies in the libraries. Furthermore, this study showed that perennial factors such as poor funding of education, inadequate quality educational infrastructure, mismanagement of education fund among others are hindrance to sustainable development in the country's educational sector. Research limitations/implications This study is limited in its use of only one state (out of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja) in Nigeria for this research. Also, social desirability bias on the part of the respondents could have influenced the pattern in which the respondents reacted to items in section D. Practical implications This study has practical implications for the sensitization and training of librarians towards leveraging on the various open access technologies in delivering effective library and information services required in the Fourth Industrial revolution. Originality/value This study seeks to pioneer a new area of focus by examining digital librarianship practice and open access technology use as enablers of sustainable development.	10.1108/DLP-01-2021-0007	Okuonghae, Omorodion; Achugbue, Edwin Iroroeavwo				J		DIGITAL LIBRARY PERSPECTIVES	English	Article; Early Access				[Okuonghae, Omorodion] Samuel Adegboyega Univ, Univ Lib, Ogwa, Nigeria; [Achugbue, Edwin Iroroeavwo] Delta State Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Cleveland, MS USA		36.0	0.0	EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD	BINGLEY	HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND	2059-5816							10.1108/DLP-01-2021-0007	WOS:000728215300001		44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=librarian	geo=NGA		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=librarian	geo=NGA

3113	Scopus	Digital Publishing Habits, Perceptions of Open Access Publishing and Other Access Publishing: Across Continents Survey Study		In this transformative world, changes are happening in all the fields, including scholarly communications are trending in the academic area of publication and access to the resources, especially emerging the wave of open access, open science and open research. The study aims to investigate the digital publishing behaviour of manuscript authors. This study applied a quantitative approach and survey questionnaire method. The researcher collected the data from 251 authors, editors, and peer-reviewers from 45 countries worldwide. The research mainly focuses on the importance, need, and author preference for open access journals. Everyone cannot use and access subscription-based journals; the critical reason is the cost of purchasing a tremendous amount. As an independent researcher, developing countries and other impoverished countries, researchers can give the utmost importance to open access journals. The author also wishes to publish a journal in open access only. The findings reveal that most authors like to publish digital and print in both formats, with chargeless publications. Open access publishing has a vital role with researchers, scholars, and students because accessing the articles is costless. The researcher publishing the manuscript is more important than the quality of the content also important in scholarly publication. Nowadays, openaccess peer-reviewed journals are also equal to the paid journals. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.		Subaveerapandiyan, A.; Mamdapur, G.M.N.; Yohapriya, K.

3121	WoS	Dissecting the tension of open science standards implementation in management and organization journals	Research integrity; science policy; open science; transparency; editorial policy; management and organization studies	Growing concerns about the credibility of scientific findings have sparked a debate on new transparency and openness standards in research. Management and organization studies scholars generally support the new standards, while emphasizing the unique challenges associated with their implementation in this paradigmatically diverse discipline. In this study, I analyze the costs to authors and journals associated with the implementation of new transparency and openness standards, and provide a progress report on the implementation level thus far. Drawing on an analysis of the submission guidelines of 60 empirical management journals, I find that the call for greater transparency was received, but resulted in implementations that were limited in scope and depth. Even standards that could have been easily adopted were left unimplemented, producing a paradoxical situation in which research designs that need transparency standards the most are not exposed to any, likely because the standards are irrelevant to other research designs.	10.1080/08989621.2021.1981870	Hensel, Przemyslaw G.

3123	Scopus	Do authors of research funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research comply with its open access mandate?: A meta-epidemiologic study	article; attention; Biomedical Research; Canada; Databases; economics; Factual; factual database; financial management; funding; human; medical research; open access publishing; Open Access Publishing; random sample; Research Support as Topic; risk factor; systematic review; Web of Science	Background Since 2008, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has mandated that studies it funds either in whole or in part are required to publish their results as open access (OA) within 12 months of publication using either online repositories and/or OA journals. Yet, there is evidence that authors are poorly compliant with this mandate. Specifically, there has been an apparent decrease in OA publication after 2015, which coincides with a change in the OA policy during the same year. One particular policy change that may have contributed to this decline was lifting the requirement that authors deposit their article in an OA repository immediately upon publication. We investigated the proportion of OA compliance of CIHR-funded studies in the period before and after the policy change of 2015 with manual confirmation of both CIHR funding and OA status. Methods and findings We identified CIHR-funded studies published between the years 2014 to 2017 using a comprehensive search in the Web of Science (WoS). We took a stratified random sample from all four years (i.e. 2014 to 2017), with 250 studies from each year. Two authors independently reviewed the final full-text publications retrieved from the journal web page to determine to confirm CIHR funding, as indicated in the acknowledgements or elsewhere in the paper. For each study, we also collected bibliometric data that included citation count and Altmetric attention score Statistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Fisher’s exact test with relative risk (RR). Among the 851 receiving CIHR funding published from 2014 to 2017, the percentage of CIHR-funded studies published as OA significantly decreased from 79.6% in 2014 to 70.3% in 2017 (RR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79–0.99, P = 0.028). When considering all four years, there was no significant difference in the percentage of CIHR-funded studies published as OA in both 2014 and 2015 compared to both 2016 and 2017 (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.90–1.05, P = 0.493). Additionally, OA publications had significantly higher citation count (both in year of publication and in total) and higher attention scores (P<0.05). Conclusions Overall, we found that there was a significant decrease in the proportion of CIHR funded studies published as OA from 2014 compared to 2017, though this difference did not persist when comparing both 2014–2015 to 2016–2017. The primary limitation was the reliance of self-reported data from authors on CIHR funding status. We posit that this decrease may be attributable to CIHR’s OA policy change in 2015. Further exploration is warranted to both validate these studies using a larger dataset and, if valid, investigate the effects of potential interventions to improve the OA compliance, such as use of a CIHR publication database, and reinstatement of a policy for authors to immediately submit their findings to OA repositories upon publication. © 2021 Scaffidi et al.

3124	WoS	Do open access journals have a greater citation impact? A study of journals in library and information science	Open access; Citation impact; Library and information science; Scholarly communication; Journals; Library science journals	Purpose This study aims to investigate the research and citation impact of open access (OA) journals versus non-OA journals being published in the spectrum of library and information science (LIS) across the world and to further ascertain whether OA journals have greater citation counts than subscription-based journals in LIS discipline. Design/methodology/approach A total of 116 LIS journals (58 OA and 58 non-OA) were chosen from Scimago website. After selecting the journals, Publish or Perish software program was used to retrieve the publications and their corresponding academic citations by using International Standard Serial Number of journals from Google Scholar for the period of 2011-2018. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test was applied on various research and citation indicators, namely, citation count, citations per author, citations per paper; g-index, h-index, hI norm and hI annual through SPSS. Findings Findings of the study demonstrate that non-OA journals in LIS have a significant citation advantage over OA journals. Moreover, Mann-Whitney U-test analysis rejected all the eight null hypotheses and reveals that non-OA journals in LIS discipline have greater citation counts, citations per author, citations per paper; g-index, h-index, hI norm and hI annual than OA journals. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that embarks upon a whole-scale investigation of citation impact of OA and non-OA journals in LIS, which has implications for both research and practice. This study would serve as a reference guide to all involved in scholarly communication activities including academic communities, librarians, research funders, publishers and policymakers for publishing research work, grant funding, designing policies and subscriptions.	10.1108/CC-03-2022-0010	Khan, D; Ashar, M; Yuvaraj, M																					2022.0					10.1108/CC-03-2022-0010			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=natscie	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3126	Scopus	Do open-access dermatology articles have higher citation counts than those with subscription-based access?		Background Open-access (OA) publishing is increasingly prevalent in dermatology, and many journals now offer hybrid options, including conventional (subscription-based access [SA]) publishing or OA (with an author publishing charge) in a subscription journal. OA publishing has been noted in many disciplines, but this has been rarely studied in dermatology. Methods Using the Clarivate Journal Citation Report, we compiled a list of English-language dermatology hybrid OA journals containing more than 5% OA articles. We sampled any OA review or original research article in 4 issues from 2018 to 2019 and matched an equal number of SA articles. Citation count, citation count excluding self-citations and view counts found using Scopus and Altmetrics score were recorded for each article. Statistical analyses were performed using logistic and negative binomial models using R software. Results Twenty-seven hybrid dermatology journals were found, and 538 articles were sampled (269 OA, 269 SA). For both original research and review articles, OA articles had significantly higher mean citation counts (mean 13.2, standard deviation [SD] 17.0) compared to SA articles (mean 7.9, SD 8.8) (odds ratio [OR] 1.04; 95% CI 1.02–1.05; P < .001) including when adjusted for time from publication. Original research OA articles had significantly higher citation counts than original research SA articles (excluding self-citations; OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05; P = .003), and review articles also had OA citation advantage than review SA articles (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02–1.11; P = .008). There was, however, no significant difference in citation counts between review articles and original research articles (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.19–5.31; P = 1.000). There was no significant difference seen in view counts (OA: mean±SD 17.7±10.8; SA: mean±SD 17.1±12.4) and Altmetric score (OA: mean±SD 13.2±47.8; SA: mean±SD 6.3 ±25.0) between OA and SA articles. Potential confounders included the fact that more OA articles were published in Europe than in Asia, and pharmaceutical-funded articles were more likely to be published OA. Conclusions We noted a higher citation count for OA articles than SA articles in dermatology hybrid journals.

3127	WoS	Do Open-Science Badges Increase Trust in Scientists Among Undergraduates, Scientists, and the Public?	badges; trust; epistemic beliefs; open science; open data; open materials; preregistered	In three experimental studies, we investigated whether badges for open-science practices have the potential to affect trust in scientists and topic-specific epistemic beliefs by student teachers (n = 270), social scientists (n = 250), or the public (n = 257), all of whom were at least 16 years old. Furthermore, we analyzed the moderating role of epistemic beliefs for badges and trust. Each participant was randomly assigned to two of three conditions: badges awarded, badges not awarded, and no badges (control). In all samples, our Bayesian analyses indicated that badges influence trust as expected, with one exception in the public sample: An additional positive effect of awarded badges (compared with no badges) was not supported. For students and scientists, we found evidence for the relation of badges and epistemic beliefs as well as epistemic beliefs and trust. Further, we found evidence for the absence of moderation by epistemic beliefs.	10.1177/09567976221097499	Schneider, J; Rosman, T; Kelava, A; Merk, S																					2022.0					10.1177/09567976221097499			44958	a=openscience	m=other	d=none	t=researcher; t=other; 	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher; t=other								
3128	Scopus	Do researchers use open research data? Exploring the relationships between usage trends and metadata quality across scientific disciplines from the Figshare case	Metadata quality; open research data usage; research repositories	Open research data (ORD) have been considered a driver of scientific transparency. However, data friction, as the phenomenon of data underutilisation for several causes, has also been pointed out. A factor often called into question for ORD low usage is the quality of the ORD and associated metadata. This work aims to illustrate the use of ORD, published by the Figshare scientific repository, concerning their scientific discipline, their type and compared with the quality of their metadata. Considering all the Figshare resources and carrying out a programmatic quality assessment of their metadata, our analysis highlighted two aspects. First, irrespective of the scientific domain considered, most ORD are under-used, but with exceptional cases which concentrate most researchers’ attention. Second, there was no evidence that the use of ORD is associated with good metadata publishing practices. These two findings opened to a reflection about the potential causes of such data friction. © The Author(s) 2020.	10.1177/0165551520961048	Quarati A., Raffaghelli J.E.																					2022.0					10.1177/0165551520961048			44958	a=opendata	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=opendata	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3130	WoS	Does open data boost journal impact: evidence from Chinese economics	Open science; Open data; Economics; Impact factor; Research transparency	To encourage research transparency and replication, more and more journals have been requiring authors to share original datasets and analytic procedures supporting their publications. Does open data boost journal impact? In this article, we report one of the first empirical studies to assess the effects of open data on journal impact. China Industrial Economics (CIE) mandated authors to open their research data in the end of 2016, which is the first to embrace open data among Chinese journals and provides a natural experiment for policy evaluation. We use the data of 37 Chinese economics journals from 2001 to 2019 and apply synthetic control method to causally estimate the effects of open data, and our results show that open data has significantly increased the citations of journal articles. On average, the current- and second-year citations of articles published with CIE have increased by 1 similar to 4 times, and articles published before the open data policy also benefited from the spillover effect. Our findings suggest that journals can leverage compulsory open data to develop reputation and amplify academic impacts.	10.1007/s11192-021-03897-z	Zhang, Liwei; Ma, Liang				J		SCIENTOMETRICS	English	Article				[Zhang, Liwei] Shandong Univ, Sch Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Ma, Liang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China		79.0	2.0	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0138-9130		2021.0	126	4	3393.0	3419.0	10.1007/s11192-021-03897-z	WOS:000617856300006	33612885.0	44958	a=opendata; a=openpolicies	m=biblio	d=socscie	t=none	geo=CHN		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=CHN							
3131	WoS	Doing Open Science in a Research-Based Seminar: Students' Positioning Towards Openness in Higher Education	Open science; open education; open education practices; open educational resources; research-based teaching; collaboration; higher education; students' attitudes	This study investigates undergraduate students' attitudes towards and experiences with open education practices (OEP) in a research-based linguistics seminar. Data was collected through written assignments in which two groups of students in subsequent terms were surveyed on their willingness to publish (a) academic posters in open access (OA); (b) teaching concepts as open educational resources (OER); and (c) personal reflections on the research process in OA. Through qualitative data analysis, we examine students' apprehensions and motivations to publish their artifacts. We find that key motivators are a sense of belonging, personal reward, and an active contribution to a culture of collaboration, whereas apprehensions are grounded in concerns about the quality of their work, uncertainties about licensing, and fear of vulnerability through visibility. We show that open science practices and OEP can be combined synergistically in process-oriented, research-based, and collaborative seminar concepts, and we formulate recommendations for lecturers on how to successfully address OEP in the classroom.

3132	WoS	Domain analysis of Brazilian open access institutional policies	Open access; Information policies; Domain analysis; Knowledge&nbsp; organization	Introduction: Open Access to scientific literature is a movement that has been developing for more than two decades and has become more complex as a domain of knowledge. Because of the advances in this area, some institutions create open access policies that express norms, values and paradigms on the subject. Objective: The objective of this study is to identify the fundamental aspects of open access representations in Brazilian institutional policies. Methodology: It uses as a qualitative approach the domain analysis and the theoretical-methodological course of content analysis through the application of the categorical technique. Performs the mapping of documents from the Melibea open access policy directory. Results: It points out that there is acknowledgment of the importance of open access as a strategy for the democratization and universalization of knowledge for society and indicates important aspects from the viewpoint of analyzed Brazilian institutions such as copyright, preservation, and open data. Conclusion: It concludes that there are terminological relationships to be considered in the open access domain and that the policies are important to institutionally align the understanding of fundamental concepts as well as to guide open access practices.	10.20396/rdbci.v20i00.8670092	Cafe, LC; Cavalcanti, VOD; de Barros, CM; Vital, LP; Alvarez, EB																					2022.0					10.20396/rdbci.v20i00.8670092			44958	a=openaccess; a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=BRA		a=openaccess	m=interview	d=none	t=none	geo=BRA							
3134	WoS	Drivers and barriers in the transition to open science: the perspective of stakeholders in the Spanish scientific community	Open science; Open access; Open research data; Research assessment; Open peer review; Scientific system; Legislation; Research funding; Feasibility; Spain	This paper presents the results of a research study whose objective was to identify the facilitating factors and barriers that, in the opinion of representatives of the Spanish scientific community, impact the implementation of the new open science model in four areas: open access, open research data, research assessment and open peer review. A qualitative study was designed in which information was obtained through interviews with researchers, editors of scientific journals, representatives of assessment agencies and vice-chancellors, and through a focus group of librarians with expertise in aspects of open science. The enabling factors and barriers identified were related to the researcher and the fruit of their research, as well as to the scientific ecosystem, which provides direct institutional support and backing (universities/research centres), the regulatory framework (management of the science system) and the science communication system (media). The results indicate that a shift in scientific practices toward the open science model can only be achieved if there is a policy framework that integrates all initiatives and links into the scientific assessment and reward system, and if the necessary funding is in place to support this transition.	10.3145/epi.2022.may.05	Gonzalez-Teruel, A; Lopez-Borrull, A; Santos-Hermosa, G; Abad-Garcia, F; Olle, C; Serrano-Vicente, R																					2022.0					10.3145/epi.2022.may.05			44958	a=openaccess; a=opendata; a=openevaluation	m=interview	d=none	t=researcher; t=librarian; t=university; t=publisher; t=other	geo=ESP		a=openaccess	m=interview	d=none	t=researcher; t=librarian; t=unisupportstaff; t=publisher	geo=ESP							
3138	WoS	Effect of policies promoting open access in the scientific ecosystem: case study of ERC grantee publication practice		The European Research Council (ERC) is one of the leading sources of research funding worldwide. This article analyses the papers published by its grantees. The primary aim was to determine the access policies of the journals chosen by researchers benefiting from public funding to disseminate their findings, based on an analysis of 44,481 papers published from 2007 to 2015. The study showed that 85% were published in hybrid or non-OA journals, with 50% to 60% of citations referring to the articles carried by such blue journals. The mean excellence rate was 6.4%, with > 11% for blue journal, nearly 8% for green journal and 6.5% for gold OA journal papers. Two lessons have been learnt from the ERC's endeavour and experience in the international scientific ecosystem in the first decade since its institution. The first is that research proposed, reviewed and funded by scientists delivers highly influential and visible results. The second is that, while complying with OA publication recommendations and mandates, grantees prefer to publish their papers in non-gold OA journals.	10.1007/s11192-021-03966-3	Perianes-Rodriguez, Antonio; Olmeda-Gomez, Carlos				J		SCIENTOMETRICS	English	Article				[Perianes-Rodriguez, Antonio; Olmeda-Gomez, Carlos] Univ Carlos III, Dept Bibliotecon & Documentac, C Madrid 128, Getafe 28903, Spain		29.0	0.0	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0138-9130		2021.0	126	8	6825.0	6836.0	10.1007/s11192-021-03966-3	WOS:000658116700005		44958	a=openaccess 	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=EU		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3150	WoS	Establishing open science research priorities in health psychology: a research prioritisation Delphi exercise	Open science; Delphi study; research prioritisation; health psychology; meta-research	Objective Research on Open Science practices in Health Psychology is lacking. This meta-research study aimed to identify research question priorities and obtain consensus on the Top 5 prioritised research questions for Open Science in Health Psychology. Methods and measures An international Delphi consensus study was conducted. Twenty-three experts in Open Science and Health Psychology within the European Health Psychology Society (EHPS) suggested research question priorities to create a 'long-list' of items (Phase 1). Forty-three EHPS members rated the importance of these items, ranked their top five and suggested their own additional items (Phase 2). Twenty-four EHPS members received feedback on Phase 2 responses and then re-rated and re-ranked their top five research questions (Phase 3). Results The top five ranked research question priorities were: 1. 'To what extent are Open Science behaviours currently practised in Health Psychology?', 2. 'How can we maximise the usefulness of Open Data and Open Code resources?', 3. 'How can Open Data be increased within Health Psychology?', 4. 'What interventions are effective for increasing the adoption of Open Science in Health Psychology?' and 5. 'How can we increase free Open Access publishing in Health Psychology?'. Conclusion Funding and resources should prioritise the research questions identified here.	10.1080/08870446.2022.2139830	Norris, E; Prescott, A; Noone, C; Green, JA; Reynolds, J; Grant, SP; Toomey, E																					2022.0					10.1080/08870446.2022.2139830			44958	a=openaccess; a=opendata; a=opensoftware	m=interview	d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=EU		a=openaccess	m=interview	d=med	t=researcher	geo=all

Platforms focused on qualitative science that support open science data and method sharing are rare. Sharing and exchanging coding schemas has great potential for supporting traceability in qualitative research as well as for facilitating the reuse of coding schemas. In this study, we present and evaluate QualiCO, an ontology to describe qualitative coding schemas. Twenty qualitative researchers used QualiCO to complete two coding tasks. In our findings, we present task performance and interview data that focus participants' attention on the ontology. Participants used QualiCO to complete the coding tasks, decreasing time on task, while improving accuracy, signifying that QualiCO enabled the reuse of qualitative coding schemas. Our discussion elaborates some issues that participants had and highlights how conceptual and prior practice frames their interpretation of how QualiCO can be used.	10.1186/s13174-021-00135-w	Hocker, Julian; Bipat, Taryn; McDonald, David W.; Zachry, Mark				J		JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS	English	Article				[Hocker, Julian] DIPF Leibniz Inst Res & Informat Educ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Bipat, Taryn; McDonald, David W.; Zachry, Mark] Univ Washington, Human Ctr Design & Engn, Washington, DC USA		55.0	0.0	SPRINGERNATURE	LONDON	CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND	1867-4828		2021.0	12	1			10.1186/s13174-021-00135-w	WOS:000683352400001		44958	a=opensoftware	m=document review; m=interview	d=natscie; d=eng 	t=researcher; t=other	geo=USA	"d -> ""While we recruited broadly at our university, all participants had a background in human-centered design or information science."""	a=opendata	m=interview	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3159	Scopus	Evaluation of Open Access Websites for Anesthesia Education		BACKGROUND: While the prevalence of free, open access medical education resources for health professionals has expanded over the past 10 years, many educational resources for health care professionals are not publicly available or require fees for access. This lack of open access creates global inequities in the availability and sharing of information and may have the most significant impact on health care providers with the greatest need. The extent of open access online educational websites aimed for clinicians and trainees in anesthesiology worldwide is unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify and evaluate the quality of websites designed to provide open access educational resources for anesthesia trainees and clinicians. METHODS: A PubMed search of articles published between 2009 and 2020, and a Startpage search engine web search was conducted in May 2021 to identify websites using the following inclusion criteria: (1) contain educational content relevant for anesthesia providers or trainees, (2) offer content free of charge, and (3) are written in the English language. Websites were each scored by 2 independent reviewers using a website quality evaluation tool with previous validity evidence that was modified for anesthesia (the Anesthesia Medical Education Website Quality Evaluation Tool). RESULTS: Seventy-five articles and 175 websites were identified; 37 websites met inclusion criteria. The most common types of educational content contained in the websites included videos (66%, 25/37), text-based resources (51%, 19/37), podcasts (35%, 13/37), and interactive learning resources (32%, 12/37). Few websites described an editorial review process (24%, 9/37) or included opportunities for active engagement or interaction by learners (30%,11/37). Scores by tertile differed significantly across multiple domains, including disclosure of author/webmaster/website institution; description of an editorial review process; relevancy to residents, fellows, and faculty; comprehensiveness; accuracy; disclosure of content creation or revision; ease of access to information; interactivity; clear and professional presentation of information; and links to external information. CONCLUSIONS: We found 37 open access websites for anesthesia education available on the Internet. Many of these websites may serve as a valuable resource for anesthesia clinicians looking for self-directed learning resources and for educators seeking to curate resources into thoughtfully integrated learning experiences. Ongoing efforts are needed to expand the number and improve the existing open access websites, especially with interactivity, to support the education and training of anesthesia providers in even the most resource-limited areas of the world. Our findings may provide recommendations for those educators and organizations seeking to fill this needed gap to create new high-quality educational websites. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

3160	Scopus	Evaluation of Open Science for co-creation of Social Innovations: A conceptual framework [Evaluación de la Ciencia Abierta para la co-creación de Innovaciones Sociales: Un marco conceptual]	co-creation; open science; social innovation; stakeholder engagement	Open Science is a rapidly expanding and diversifying field of social innovation with significant implications for and potential benefits to society, policy and various academic research areas. However, much is still unknown about the co-creation processes in Open Science and an overall conceptual framework which aids such understanding is missing. The article aims to address these limitations and identify the key dimensions of an ecosystem allowing co-creation in Open Science to unfold its social and economic impact. The research presented integrates the literature analysis on co-creation in multi-stakeholder ecosystems and suggest that three important dimensions have to be considered in evaluation of Open Science ecosystems: framework conditions, system conditions and outcomes. The proposed model was applied in qualitative analysis of thirty-three Open Science case studies. Based on the results of evaluation, it can be concluded that Open Science landscape is highly heterogenous, fragmented and not fully coordinated. The fragmentation appeared in all dimensions of evaluation. The outcomes of the research provide a first exploratory step in proposing innovative measures to determine the elements of co-creation practices within Open Science context. © 2022, Sinnergiak Social Innovation.

3163	WoS	EXPERIENCE OF IMPLEMENTATING INSITUTIONAL POLICIES ON OPEN SCIENCE IN EUROPEAN UNIVERSITIES	European Research Area; European Higher Education Area; Open Science; European Universities; Institutional Policies for Open Science Development	In the conditions of the war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and the postwar period, the urgency of improving the quality of research for economic recovery and state building is growing. Improving research by improving the exchange, transfer and access to scientific knowledge through knowledge transfer and open innovation is ensured by the implementation of the Open Science concept. To determine the guidelines for the development and implementation of Open Science in domestic universities, the author's definition of Open Science is proposed, the experience of leading European universities (University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Imperial College London) and the results of a survey conducted by the European University Association is analyzed. An analysis of the experience of leading European universities has shown that the main areas of implementation of Open Science policy are open access, open data, research data management and dissemination. The results of a survey of representatives of 272 European universities on the implementation of Open Science showed that openness of research is an important part of institutional priorities, policies and practices. The most relevant factors contributing to the transition to Open Science, the respondents are identified the following: the presence of national policy / recommendations on Open Science; taking into account the observance of the principles of Open Science in the requirements for research funding; availability of EU policy / recommendations on Open Science. Obstacles that hinder universities from implementing Open Science policy include the following: lack of incentives to promote Open Science policy; problems of legal support; financial problems. The conducted SWOT-analysis allowed to identify the strengths and weaknesses, risks and opportunities for the implementation of Open Science policy in European universities. Recommendations for the implementation of Open Science policy in universities are offered.	10.33407/itlt.v90i4.4945	Drach, II; Lytvynova, SH; Slobodianiuk, OM																					2022.0					10.33407/itlt.v90i4.4945			44958	a=openscience; a=openpolicies	m=survey	d=none	t=university	geo=EU		a=openscience	m=interview	d=none	t=none	geo=all

The general objective of this study was to establish the extent to which academic staff are engaged in depositing locally produced content in open access institutional repositories. The study employed a cross-sectional research design. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire, which was administered to 292 academic staff selected through systematic random sampling. Purposive sampling was used to select 14 key informants. The results reveal that 92.5% of the respondents were aware of the presence of open access institutional repositories and 46.2% of the respondents had self-archived their academic work in open access institutional repositories. Poor Internet connectivity, low bandwidth, and a time-consuming and unstable power supply were the challenges encountered by the academic staff in the process of uploading their work. Several recommendations are suggested to expedite the process.	10.1177/03400352211069157	Mbughuni, AS; Mtega, WP; Malekani, AW																					2022.0					10.1177/03400352211069157			44958	a=openaccess; a=opentools	m=survey; m=interview	d=none	t=researcher	geo=TZA		a=openscience	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=TZA							
3169	WoS	Exploring learning opportunities for students in open data portal use across data literacy levels	Open data; Open data portals; Informal learning; Situated learning; Data literacy; Information system design; Usability	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore open data portals as data literacy learning environments. The authors examined the obstacles faced and strategies used by university students as non-expert open data portal users with different levels of data literacy, to inform the design of portals intended to scaffold informal and situated learning. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an observational user study, in which 14 student participants grouped by self-reported data literacy measures carried out assigned tasks in an open data portal. Data were collected through screen capture, think-aloud protocols and post-session interviews. Findings - Participants experienced numerous challenges in finding and using data, with some variation shown between the different literacy groups. The higher data literacy group primarily faced challenges using unfamiliar tools, which may be addressed by improving system usability, while the lower data literacy group struggled due to gaps in basic understanding, which may be addressed by increasing point of need instruction and guidance. Participants used several learning strategies but primarily relied upon trial and error, which was less effective for low data literacy users. Originality/value - This study is unique in comparing open data portal use among adult students across data literacy levels through an empirical user study. It contributes methodologically by proposing an instrument for data literacy assessment. It offers a novel perspective on information systems as sites for informal learning and skills development, beyond the immediate goals of system use, and offers concrete suggestions for the future design of open data portals for students and non-expert, citizen users.	10.1108/ILS-01-2022-0003	Li, AW; Sinnamon, LS; Kopak, R																					2022.0					10.1108/ILS-01-2022-0003			44958	a=opendata; a=opentools	m=other	d=natscie; d=socscie; d=hum	t=other	geo=CAN	about data literacy of students, OD from Open Government Data	a=opendata	m=interview	d=none	t=other	geo=CAN

3174	WoS	Exploring the social activity of open research data on ResearchGate: implications for the data literacy of researchers	Open research data; Academic social networks; Open data use; Open data quality; Researchers data literacy	Purpose - Although current research has investigated how open research data (ORD) are published, researchers' behaviour of ORD sharing on academic social networks (ASNs) remains insufficiently explored. The purpose of this study is to investigate the connections between ORDs publication and social activity to uncover data literacy gaps. Design/methodology/approach - This work investigates whether the ORDs publication leads to social activity around the ORDs and their linked published articles to uncover data literacy needs. The social activity was characterised as reads and citations, over the basis of a non-invasive approach supporting this preliminary study. The eventual associations between the social activity and the researchers' profile (scientific domain, gender, region, professional position, reputation) and the quality of the ORD published were investigated to complete this picture. A random sample of ORD items extracted from ResearchGate (752 ORDs) was analysed using quantitative techniques, including descriptive statistics, logistic regression and K-means cluster analysis. Findings - The results highlight three main phenomena: (1) Globally, there is still an underdeveloped social activity around self-archived ORDs in ResearchGate, in terms of reads and citations, regardless of the published ORDs quality; (2) disentangling the moderating effects over social activity around ORD spots traditional dynamics within the innovative practice of engaging with data practices; (3) a somewhat similar situation of ResearchGate as ASN to other data platforms and repositories, in terms of social activity around ORD, was detected. Research limitations/implications - Although the data were collected within a narrow period, the random data collection ensures a representative picture of researchers' practices. Practical implications - As per the implications, the study sheds light on data literacy requirements to promote social activity around ORD in the context of open science as a desirable frontier of practice. Originality/value - Researchers data literacy across digital systems is still little understood. Although there are many policies and technological infrastructure providing support, the researchers do not make an in-depth use of them.	10.1108/OIR-05-2021-0255	Raffaghelli, JE; Manca, S																					2022.0					10.1108/OIR-05-2021-0255			44958	a=opendata; a=opentools	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3176	WoS	Extraction and validation of scientific data for the identification of publications in open access journals	Data integration; &nbsp; Directory of Open Access Journals; &nbsp; Lattes Platform; &nbsp; Open access	This work aims to identify articles published in open access journals registered in the Lattes Platform curricula. Currently, the curricular data from the Lattes Platform has been the source of several studies that adopt bibliometric metrics to understand scientific evolution in Brazil. However, when registering a publication in a curriculum, only basic information from the magazine is informed. Therefore, to quantify the publications made in open access journals, a strategy is proposed that uses data from the Directory of Open Access Journals, validating the publications and, thus, obtaining a process that allows identifying which publications were made in this communication format. Therefore, using the proposed methodology, which has a low computational cost, it was possible to quantify in an unprecedented way the publications of Brazilians in open access journals registered in the curricula of the Lattes Platform. In addition, having the authors' data of the publications, it was possible to understand how these authors are geographically distributed in the country, what their areas of operation are and how they have published the results of their research in open access. It is noteworthy that they are generally published in Portuguese and English. Over the last few years, the representativeness of publications in open access journals has increased.	10.1590/2318-0889202234e210040	Dias, PM; Dias, TMR; Moita, GF; Pinto, AL																					2022.0					10.1590/2318-0889202234e210040			44958	a=openaccess 	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=BRA		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=BRA							
3180	WoS	Factors influencing Lithuanian researchers' use of open access repositories as a publishing channel		Introduction. The aim of the paper is to establish which factors and to what extent affect the intention of Lithuanian researchers to use open access repositories as a publication channel. Method. The model of the theory of planned behaviour was employed to better understand the intentions of Lithuanian researchers to deposit their publications to research repositories. A representative questionnaire survey was carried out to collect the data. The 545 respondents of the survey were the Lithuanian researchers who have a doctoral degree and work at Lithuanian state universities or state research institutes. Analysis. The obtained data were analysed using correlational analysis Results. It was found that the most significant factors that affect Lithuanian researchers' intention to submit their publications to repositories are perceived norm, perceived control and past open access publishing behaviour. The age and seniority of researchers are also significant. Conclusions. Lithuanian researchers differ from the general context of open access publishing behaviour in that the influence of norms on the intention to submit publications to open access repositories is greater than that of researchers in other countries, and the attitudes, although positive, are less significant. Lithuanian researchers representing social sciences and humanities are slightly more likely to submit publications to the repositories than researchers representing the natural science, medicine and technology.	10.47989/irisic2210	Maceviciute, E; Kepaliene, F																					2022.0					10.47989/irisic2210			44958	a=opentools	m=survey	d=socscie; d=med; d=hum; d=eng; d=natscie	t=researcher	geo=LTU		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=LTU							
3181	WoS	Factors influencing researchers to publish in open-access: Is it a self-decision or a self-reinforcing cycle?	Open-access (OA) publication; Researchers' perceptions; Behavioral intentions to publish OA; Voluntariness of publication; Actual publications in OA	PurposeThe current study examined Israeli researchers from various disciplines concerning their perceptions, attitudes and awareness of scientific publications in open access (OA) journals and repositories.Design/methodology/approachA survey instrument was developed and distributed to 202 Israeli researchers from universities, colleges and research institutions. The study used the united theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model as a tool for mapping the factors known to influence researchers to publish in OA journals and repositories.FindingsThe empirical model confirmed the mediating effect of the association between researchers' perceptions and the actual publishing in OA, through their behavioral intentions (BI). Furthermore, the BI are mediated by researchers' self-decision to publish in OA. More specifically, a researcher's publication level in OA depended not only on the positive attitudes (Atti), performance expectancy (PE) and social influence (SI) mediated by BI, but also on conditions that support researchers who publish in OA, and disciplinary affiliation to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) which lead the researcher to voluntarily publish in both green and gold OA.Research limitations/implicationsThis study contributed to the cumulative understanding of OA publishing by formulating and validating an empirical research model of acceptance and use.Practical implicationsThe implications of the findings for scientific publication theory and practices are discussed.Originality/valueThe study suggests an effective framework to understand the researcher's final decision to publish in OA. This study's results are an essential step towards the cumulative understanding of OA publicity adoption and use by researchers as a global issue in general and in Israeli academic institutions in particular.	10.1108/OIR-01-2022-0014	Hadad, S; Aharony, N																					2022.0					10.1108/OIR-01-2022-0014			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=ISR		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=ISR							
3182	WoS	Factors influencing the adoption and use of open access scholarly communication among researchers in India	Scholarly communication; Open acCess; Open access journals; Gold road-open access; Adoption and use-open access; Factor-open access	Purpose - The present study aims to examine the use of open access (OA) scholarly communication in India and investigate the factors affecting the adoption and use of OA scholarly communication among researchers. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted a quantitative research approach using a survey method. Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) of Web of Science database was selected as a source for identifying potential researchers and researchers' contact details. A web-based questionnaire was designed using Google Forms, and a link to the questionnaire was sent by email to 4,237 researchers belonging to Science and Technology. Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is the primary basis for formulating the present study's conceptual model. Hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) was applied for identifying the factors that influence the adoption and use of OA scholarly communication. Findings -The study found that researchers have limited knowledge of different OA concepts, initiatives and resources, resulting in a deficient level of participation in OA publishing. The HMR analysis authenticates that attitude, facilitating conditions, Internet usage self-efficacy, article processing charge (APC) and researchers' working experience significantly influence the adoption and use of OA scholarly communication. Based on the findings, the study proposed a validated model to investigate the adoption and use of OA scholarly communication in different institutions, research disciplines and developing countries with similar conditions. Practical implications - The findings have several practical and policy implications for improving OA publishing in India, formulating OA policies and providing directions for further research. Originality/value - This is the first study focusing on adopting and using OA scholarly communication in India. Findings may be helpful in planning and implementing OA initiatives. The influencing factors and the relative importance identified in the present study offered empirical evidence to demonstrate the researchers' attitudes and perceptions for adopting and using OA scholarly communication.	10.1108/OIR-05-2021-0265	Nazim, M; Ashar, M																					2022.0					10.1108/OIR-05-2021-0265			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=natscie; d=eng	t=researcher	geo=IND		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=IND							
3183	WoS	Factors influencing the adoption and use of open access scholarly publishing in selected public universities in Kenya	Open access; scholarly publishing; scientific research; public universities	The purpose of the study was to explore the factors that influence the adoption and use of open access scholarly publishing (OASP) by researchers in selected public universities in Kenya. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model as a study lens and the questionnaire as the data collection tool, the study collected data from academic researchers in three Kenyan public universities, namely the University of Nairobi (UoN), Kenyatta University (KU) and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT).The findings of the study indicate that there are several factors associated with facilitating conditions (FC), performance expectancy (PE), internet skills, and social influence (SI) that influence there searchers' intention to adopt and use OASP in the selected universities. Consequently, we believe that addressing the inhibitors of the adoption of OASP in Kenyan universities would be key to the successful and effective use of OASP. Enablers such as ICT infrastructure, staff capacity and clear policies should be enhanced so as to optimise researchers' capabilities. Based on the findings, the study makes several recommendations to improve the adoption and use of OASP in Kenya's institutions of higher learning.	10.7553/88-1-2049	Waithaka, M; Chilimo, W; Onyancha, OB																					2022.0					10.7553/88-1-2049			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=KEN		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=KEN							
3184	WoS	Factors that determine open data readiness among scholars: experience from selected universities in Tanzania	Universities; Tanzania; Research data management; Open science; Open data; Data sharing; Research data	Purpose This study aims to investigate the factors determining the readiness for uptake of open data (OD) in Tanzania. Specifically, this study intended to answer the question that sought to find out the factors that influence the implementation of OD in universities under study in a view to aligning with recommended strategies for optimizing the use of data in the open science era. Design/methodology/approach This study used a cross-sectional survey design whereby data were collected using quantitative and qualitative research approaches. A sample size of 212 respondents was drawn from the sampling frame of a population of 1,846 researchers from the participating universities using both probability and nonprobability sampling techniques. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from researchers while interviews were administered to decision-makers. These two groups were believed to have the necessary knowledge for this study. Findings The findings indicate low or lack of skills and awareness on issues related to OD among researchers and decision-makers. This study also reveals inadequate infrastructure to support open science initiatives including OD. Moreover, this study shows a lack of supportive institutional strategies and policies that trigger the implementation of OD initiatives in Tanzania. This study recommends that universities should uplift the level of confidence of researchers by ensuring all necessary factors determining the uptake of OD are in place before and during the implementation of OD initiatives. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted during the time when researchers in universities are in an infant stage of adopting the concept from the developed world. In this regard, it is important to carry out a tracer study on establishing the OD phenomena after a number of universities have implemented OD initiatives in the country. Practical implications The researchers recommend the establishment of institutional policy and strategies to guide the implementation of OD among universities in Tanzania. Including awareness creation awareness through providing training among researchers and academics in universities. The results shed light to decision-makers on the understanding of the role of sharing research data in enhancing openness and validation of findings to increase the authenticity of results among researchers. Social implications The authors have revealed the factors affecting the implementation of OD among scholars in universities. This study reveals the level of acceptance of OD initiatives and the factors that could trigger adoption of OD. Originality/value This paper presents factors that determine the readiness for the uptake of OD in universities in Tanzania from the researcher's perspective. This study was conducted to fill the knowledge gap that sought to establish understanding of researchers about OD. The gap was established through literature and it was found that none of the presented studies researched on this phenomenon in Tanzania.	10.1108/IDD-10-2021-0111	Buhomoli, OS; Muneja, PS																					2022.0					10.1108/IDD-10-2021-0111			44958	a=opendata	m=survey; m=interview	d=none	t=researcher; t=university	geo=TZA		a=opendata	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=TZA							
3185	WoS	Faculty Attitudes Towards Article Processing Charges for Open Access Articles	Open Access; Article Processing Charges; Academic Publishing; NIH Public Access Policy; Hybrid Journals; Health Sciences Faculty	Article Processing Charges (APCs) are significant charges for publishing Open Access (OA), and have no accepted standards for authors to source the funds or negotiate the charges. While there is a growing body of literature exploring academic authors' perceptions of OA publishing, there is little data on how authors pay for APCs. The aim of this study was to examine how authors prepare for and fund APCs, as well as their perceptions of these charges. In early 2021 the authors deployed a survey to Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai faculty members via email. The survey was completed by 310 faculty, representing 10.6% of the active researcher population. Our findings show that about 50% of respondents include anticipated APC costs in grant applications, and that 16% of faculty will pay APCs using personal funds. Questions evaluating perception of APCs show that while the majority of respondents support the concept of Open Access, most believe that charges are too high and should not fall on authors.	10.1007/s12109-021-09820-x	Halevi, Gali; Walsh, Samantha				J		PUBLISHING RESEARCH QUARTERLY	English	Article				[Halevi, Gali; Walsh, Samantha] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA		20.0	0.0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES	1053-8801		2021.0	37	3	384.0	398.0	10.1007/s12109-021-09820-x	WOS:000670197100001		44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=med	t=researcher	geo=USA		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=med	t=researcher	geo=USA							
3186	WoS	Faculty Use of Open-Access Journals: A Case Study of Faculty Publications and Cited References at a California University	scholarly communication; publishing; authorship; open access; journals; publishing strategies; research habits	Many in the library world see open-access (OA) publishing as the way of the future, necessary to combat ever-rising costs, expand knowledge and information production, and level the playing field for researchers and students across the world. However, ingrained notions of the publishing process in academia, and concerns over OA journals' quality and costs often make researchers less enthusiastic. This study takes a close look at faculty habits at the college-department level by reviewing faculty publishing habits and cited references in those publications. Results show that the faculty in the Psychology Department at California State University, Los Angeles regularly publish at all OA levels, but utilize formal self-archiving less than what is found in their cited references. Furthermore, the department faculty cite fully OA (Gold) journals less than they publish in them.	10.3390/publications9030039	Faulkner, Kendall				J		PUBLICATIONS	English	Article				[Faulkner, Kendall] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Univ Lib, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA		33.0	0.0	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND			2021.0	9	3			10.3390/publications9030039	WOS:000700166500001		44958	a=openaccess	m=document review; a=biblio	d=socscie	t=none	geo=USA	authors conclude from OA characteristics of publications on publication behavior of researchers (17 researcher publications analysed) = include t=researcher?	a=openaccess	m=other	d=med	t=researcher	geo=USA							
3188	WoS	FAIR Versus Open Data: A Comparison of Objectives and Principles	FAIR Guidelines; FAIR data; Open data; Data management	This article assesses the difference between the concepts of 'open data' and 'FAIR data' in data management. FAIR data is understood as data that complies with the FAIR Guidelines-data that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable-while open data was born out of awareness of the need to democratise data by improving its accessibility, based on the idea that data should not have limitations that prevent people from using it. This study compared FAIR data with open data by analysing relevant documents using a coding analysis with conceptual labels based on Kingdon's theory of agenda setting. The study found that in relation to FAIR data the problem stream focuses on the complexity of data collected for research, while open data primarily emphasises giving the public access to non-confidential data. In the policy stream, the two concepts share common standpoints in terms of making data available and reusable, although different approaches are adopted in practice to accomplish these goals. In the politics stream, stakeholders with different objectives support FAIR data and from those who support open data.	10.1162/dint_a_00176	Jati, PHP; Lin, Y; Nodehi, S; Cahyono, DB; van Reisen, M																					2022.0					10.1162/dint_a_00176			44958	a=opendata; a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=opendata	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3192	WoS	Finding My Way from clinical trial to open access dissemination: comparison of uptake, adherence, and psychosocial outcomes of an online program for cancer-related distress	Digital health; Psycho-oncology; Intervention; Dissemination; Open access	Purpose Few digital psycho-oncology programs have been adopted into routine practice; how these programs are used after trial completion remains unexplored. To address this, the present study transitioned our evidence-based 6-module CBT-based program, Finding My Way, into open access (OA) after completion of the RCT, and compared uptake, usage, and psychosocial outcomes to the earlier RCT. Methods Recruitment was passive, via promotion through (1) media and social media releases, (2) public lectures, (3) radio interviews and podcasts, and (4) clinician-initiated referral. Measures included number of enrolled users, number of modules completed, and pre- and optional post-measures of distress and quality of life (QOL). Results Uptake was lower in OA (n = 120; 63% of RCT). Usage was markedly lower: 1.5 modules were completed on average (vs 3.7 in RCT), and only 13% completed a 'therapeutic dose' of 4 + modules (vs. 50% in RCT). Research attrition was high; n = 13 completed post-measures. OA users were more sociodemographically and clinically diverse than RCT users, had higher baseline distress (OA M-pre = 36.7, SD = 26.5; RCT M-pre = 26.5, SD = 21.7), and reported larger pre-post reductions than their RCT counterparts (OA M-post = 23.9, SD = 20.7; RCT M-post = 21.2, SD = 21.2). Moderate improvements in mental QOL occurred during OA (M-pre = 37.3, SD = 12.6; M-post = 44.5, SD = 12.1), broadly replicating RCT findings. Conclusion Findings that OA users were more medically and sociodemographically diverse and distressed at baseline than their RCT counterparts, and - despite having lower usage of the program - achieved larger changes from baseline to post-program, will help to shape future intervention design, tailoring, and dissemination.	10.1007/s00520-022-07205-0	Beatty, L; Kemp, E; Koczwara, B																					2022.0					10.1007/s00520-022-07205-0			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all	not relevant because mainly about program  that is openly accessibly												
3198	WoS	Free for all, or free-for-all? A content analysis of Australian university open access policies		Introduction. The purpose of this paper is to understand the characteristics of Australian institutional open access policies and to explore the extent they represent a coherent and unified approach to delivering and promoting open access in Australia. Method. Open access policies were located using a systematic search of forty-two Australian university Websites. A formal open access policy was defined as a document with the terms open access and policy in the title, and which was located either in the institution's policy library, or elsewhere on the main university Website. Analysis. Content analysis was employed to examine policies across fourteen categories. Results. Only twenty Australian universities were found to have a formal open access policy. There was found to be a wide variation in language used, expressed intent of the policy and expectations of researchers. Few policies mentioned monitoring or compliance. Conclusions. When policies use language which does not reflect national and international understandings, and when requirements are not clear and with consequences, policies are unlikely to contribute to understanding of open access, to uptake of the policy, or to ease of transferring understanding and practices between institutions. A more unified institutional approach to open access is recommended.	10.47989/irpaper933	Wakeling, S; Kingsley, D; Jamali, HR; Kennan, MA; Sarrafzadeh, M																					2022.0					10.47989/irpaper933			44958	a=openaccess; a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=none	t=university; t=none	geo=AUS		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=AUS							
3208	WoS	Gambling researchers' use and views of open science principles and practices: a brief report	Gambling; research design; reliability; best practice; survey	Scientists across disciplines have begun to implement 'open science' principles and practices, which are designed to enhance the quality, transparency, and replicability of scientific research. Yet, studies examining the use of open science practices in social science fields such as psychology and economics show that awareness and use of such practices often is low. In gambling studies research, no studies to date have empirically investigated knowledge of and use of open science practices. In the present study, we collected survey data about awareness and use of open science practices from 86 gambling studies research stakeholders who had attended a major international gambling studies conference in May 2019. We found that - as hypothesized - a minority of gambling research stakeholders reported: 1) either some or extensive experience using open science research practices in general, and 2) either some or regular experience using specific open science practices, including study pre-registration, open materials/code, open data, and pre-print archiving. Most respondents indicated that replication was important for all studies in gambling research, and that genetic, neuroscience, and lab-based game characteristic studies were areas most in need of replication. Our results have important implications for open science education initiatives and for contemporary research methodology in gambling studies.	10.1080/14459795.2021.1891272	LaPlante, Debi A.; Louderback, Eric R.; Abarbanel, Brett				J		INTERNATIONAL GAMBLING STUDIES	English	Article				[LaPlante, Debi A.; Louderback, Eric R.] Cambridge Hlth Alliance, Div Addict, 350 Main St,Suite 630, Malden, MA 02148 USA; [LaPlante, Debi A.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Abarbanel, Brett] Univ Nevada, Int Gaming Inst, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Abarbanel, Brett] Univ Nevada, William F Harrah Coll Hospitality, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Abarbanel, Brett] Univ Sydney, Gambling Treatment & Res Clin, Sydney, NSW, Australia		42.0	0.0	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	1445-9795		2021.0	21	3	381.0	394.0	10.1080/14459795.2021.1891272	WOS:000635811000001		44958	a=openscience	m=survey	d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=all		a=openscience	m=survey	d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=all							
3213	WoS	Green Open Access in Astronomy and Mathematics: The Complementarity of Routines Among Authors and Readers	Open access; Digital publishing; Open science; Disciplinary cultures; Digital infrastructure; E-research	Open access (OA) to publications has become a major topic in science policy. However, electronic publication providing free access to research via the internet is more than a decade older, was invented in the 1990s and driven by parts of the scientific community. This paper focuses on two disciplines (astronomy and mathematics) in which green OA is well established. It asks how authors and readers use the central disciplinary repository and how they are thereby included in the communication system of their disciplines. Drawing on an interview study with 20 scientists from both disciplines, we analyze the main characteristics of an inclusion, possible problems that result from it and how they are being solved. The empirical results show that there is a complementarity between the routines of authors and readers that co-stabilize each other. This finding suggests that the emergence of complementary routines could be a necessary condition for the green OA model to succeed.	10.1007/s11024-020-09424-3	Taubert, Niels				J		MINERVA	English	Article				[Taubert, Niels] Bielefeld Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Studies Sci I2SoS, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany		65.0	0.0	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0026-4695		2021.0	59	2	173.0	194.0	10.1007/s11024-020-09424-3	WOS:000598296900001		44958	a=openaccess	m=interview	d=natscie	t=researcher	geo=GER; geo=ZAF		a=openaccess	m=interview	d=engtech	t=researcher	geo=all

Methods: We performed a scoping review guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s framework and Joanna Briggs’ Manual for Scoping Reviews. Our search methods consisted of searching five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LISTA, and Web of Science Core Collection), reference harvesting, and targeted website and journal searching. To determine study eligibility, we applied predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria and reached consensus when there was disagreement. We extracted data in duplicate and performed qualitative analysis to map key themes. Results: We included fifty-four studies. Research methods included descriptive or narrative approaches (76%); surveys, questionnaires, and interviews (15%); or mixed methods (9%). We labeled studies with one or more of FOSTER's six OS themes: open access (54%), open data (43%), open science (24%), open education (6%), open source (6%), and citizen science (6%). Key drivers in OS were scientific integrity and transparency, openness as a guiding principle in research, and funder mandates making research publicly accessible. Conclusions: HSLs play key roles in advancing OS worldwide. Formal studies are needed to assess the impact of HSLs’ engagement in OS. HSLs should promote adoption of OS within their research communities and develop strategic plans aligned with institutional partners. HSLs can promote OS by adopting more rigorous and transparent research practices of their own. Future research should examine HSLs’ engagement in OS through social justice and equity perspectives. © 2021, Medical Library Association.

3223	WoS	High-throughput analysis suggests differences in journal false discovery rate by subject area and impact factor but not open access status	False discovery rate; Replication; Reproducibility; Cancer; Open access; Impact factor	BackgroundA low replication rate has been reported in some scientific areas motivating the creation of resource intensive collaborations to estimate the replication rate by repeating individual studies. The substantial resources required by these projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings. We extend the use of a method from Jager and Leek to estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a 5-year period using p values from over 30,000 abstracts enabling the study of how the false discovery rate varies by journal characteristics. ResultsWe find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer versus general medicine journals (p=9.801E-07, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.097; adjusted mean false discovery rate cancer=0.264 vs. general medicine=0.194). We also find that false discovery rate is negatively associated with log journal impact factor. A two-fold decrease in journal impact factor is associated with an average increase of 0.020 in FDR (p=2.545E-04). Conversely, we find no statistically significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access versus closed access journals (p=0.320, 95% CI -0.015, 0.046, adjusted mean false discovery rate Open Access=0.241 vs. closed access=0.225).ConclusionsOur results identify areas of research that may need additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science. Given our publicly available R code and data, others can complete a broad assessment of the empirical false discovery rate across other subject areas and characteristics of published research.	10.1186/s12859-020-03817-7	Hall, L.

Current status; Legal frameworks; Metadata; Open Data; Performance indicators; Semantics	Every university in Greece is obliged to comply with the national legal framework on open data. The rising question is how such a big and diverse organization could support open data from an administrative, legal and technical point of view, in a way that enables gradual improvement of the open data-related services. In this paper, we describe our experience, as University of Crete, for tackling these requirements. In particular, (a) we detail the steps of the process that we followed, (b) we show how an Open Data Catalog can be exploited also in the first steps of this process, (c) we describe the platform that we selected, how we organized the catalog and the metadata selection, (d) we describe extensions that were required, and (e) we discuss the current status, performance indicators, and possible next steps. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	10.1007/978-3-030-71903-6_16	Tzitzikas, Y.; Pitikakis, M.; Giakoumis, G.; Varouha, K.; Karkanaki, E.

A mixed-methodological survey of International Communication Association members (N = 330) suggested widespread familiarity with and support for some OSPs, but less engagement with them. In open-ended responses, respondents expressed several concerns, including reservations about unclear standards, presumed incompatibility with scholarly approaches, fears of a misuse of shared materials, and perceptions of a toxic culture surrounding open scholarship. © 2022 The Author(s).

3230	WoS	How Does Open Access Publication Impact Readership and Citation Rates of Lumbar Spine Literature?	open access; lumbar spine; citation; Altmetric	Study Design: This was a retrospective review. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of open access (OA) publication on citation rates and attention scores of literature related to lumbar spine surgery. Summary of Background Data: OA literature allows readers to view full-text manuscripts of research publications free of charge, however, OA publication is often associated with substantial fees for authors. Methods: The Altmetric database was searched for articles related to lumbar spine surgery. Title, journal, publication date, Dimensions Citations, Mendeley Readers, Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), number of public mentions, and OA status were collected for each included article. The influence of OA status on Dimensions Citations, Mendeley Readers, and each individual component of the AAS was assessed. To control for journal influence, impact of OA on Dimensions Citations and AAS was separately assessed for each of the top 10 journals contributing the most mentioned articles. The top 25 most cited articles and top 25 articles by AAS were also characterized. Results: A total of 5245 articles were included, of which 2063 were published with OA and 3182 were not. OA status was a significant, independent predictor of AAS and Mendeley Readers (both P<0.001), but not Dimensions Citations (P=0.422). OA status significantly predicted mentions in news stories (P=0.003), Twitter posts (P<0.001), Facebook posts (P<0.001), and Wikipedia citations (P=0.011). Of the top 10 contributing journals, OA status significantly predicted Dimensions Citations for European Spine Journal, Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine, and Neurosurgery (P <= 0.005) and predicted AAS for Spine, European Spine Journal, The Spine Journal, Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine, and Neurosurgery (P <= 0.017, all). Discussion: OA status appeared to significantly impact public attention scores, but not citation rates, although these effects did vary based on the journal in which articles were published. Authors may want to consider OA publication based on their target audience and the goal of their research.	10.1097/BSD.0000000000001303	Lynch, CP; Cha, EDK; Patel, MR; Jacob, KC; Prabhu, MC; Pawlowski, H; Vanjani, NN; Singh, K																					2022.0					10.1097/BSD.0000000000001303			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all	biblio including altmetrics	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3232	WoS	How is open access publishing going down with early career researchers? An international, multi-disciplinary study	Early career researchers; Researchers: ECR; Open access; OA; Open publishing; International study; Views; Practices; Opinions; Behaviours; Attitudes; Advantages and disadvantages; Millennials; Gender; Age; Country differences; Discipline variances	This study explores early career researchers' (ECRs) appreciation and utilisation of open access (OA) publishing. The evidence reported here results from a questionnaire-based international survey with 1600 participants, which forms the second leg and final year of a four year long, mixed methods, longitudinal study that sought to discover whether ECRs will be the harbingers of change when it comes to scholarly communications. Proceeding from the notion that today's neophyte researchers, believed to hold millennial values of openness to change, transparency and sharing, may be best placed to power the take-up of OA publishing, the study sought to discover: the extent to which ECRs publish OA papers; the main reasons for their doing or not doing so; and what were thought to be the broader advantages and disadvantages of OA publishing. The survey data is presented against a backdrop of the literature-based evidence on the subject, with the interview stage data providing contextualisation and qualitative depth. The findings show that the majority of ECRs published in OA journals and this varied by discipline and country. Most importantly, there were more advantages and fewer disadvantages to OA publishing, which may be indicative of problems to do with cost and availability, rather than reputational factors. Among the many reasons cited for publishing OA the most important one is societal, although OA is seen as especially benefiting ECRs in career progression. Cost is plainly considered the main downside.	10.3145/epi.2020.nov.14	Nicholas, David; Jamali, Hamid R.; Herman, Eti; Xu, Jie; Boukacem-Zeghmouri, Cherifa; Watkinson, Anthony; Rodriguez-Bravo, Blanca; Abrizah, Abdullah; Swigon, Marzena; Polezhaeva, Tatiana				J		PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION	English	Article				[Nicholas, David; Herman, Eti; Watkinson, Anthony] CIBER Res Ltd, Newbury RG14 7RU, Berks, England; [Jamali, Hamid R.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Locked Bag 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia; [Xu, Jie] Wuhan Univ, Sch Informat Management, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Boukacem-Zeghmouri, Cherifa] Univ Lyon, Dept Comp Sci, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France; [Rodriguez-Bravo, Blanca] Univ Leon, Fac Filosofia & Tetras, Area Bibliotecon & Documentac, Leon 24071, Spain; [Abrizah, Abdullah] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Swigon, Marzena] Uniwersytet Warminsko Mazurski, Wydzial Humanisty, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland; [Polezhaeva, Tatiana] Tomsk State Univ, Lab Lib & Commun Studies, Tomsk, Russia; [Polezhaeva, Tatiana] Lib Foreign Literature, Moscow, Russia		114.0	2.0	 EDICIONES PROFESIONALES INFORMACION SL-EPI	BARCELONA	MISTRAL, 36, BARCELONA, ALBOLOTE, SPAIN	1386-6710		2020.0	29	6			10.3145/epi.2020.nov.14	WOS:000607630000014		44958	a=openaccess	m=survey; m=interview	d=eng; d=natscie; d=hum; d=med; d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=NA; geo=RUS; geo=CHN; geo=EU; geo=GBR		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=all

It is well accepted within the literature that sport and exercise practitioners, such as coaches and sport scientists, perceive several barriers to access of scientific and academic research. Open-access podcasts may provide an alternative platform for developing esoteric knowledge. Nine sport and exercise practitioners (including gym owners, nutritionists, and sport coaches) participated in the investigation. A single-semi structured interview was conducted, and data were analyzed using a thematic network analysis approach. Three themes were constructed from the data-flexibility of podcast listening, convenience of podcast listening, practitioners' need for authentic and novel information.	10.3389/feduc.2021.666865	Shaw, Matthew P.; McNamara, Scott W.

3242	WoS	Identifying scientific publications countrywide and measuring their open access: The case of the French Open Science Barometer (BSO)	databases; open science; publications	We use several sources to collect and evaluate academic scientific publication on a country-wide scale, and we apply it to the case of France for the years 2015-2020, while presenting a more detailed analysis focused on the reference year 2019. These sources are diverse: databases available by subscription (Scopus, Web of Science) or open to the scientific community (Microsoft Academic Graph), the national open archive HAL, and databases serving thematic communities (ADS and PubMed). We show the contribution of the different sources to the final corpus. These results are then compared to those obtained with another approach, that of the French Open Science Barometer for monitoring open access at the national level. We show that both approaches provide a convergent estimate of the open access rate. We also present and discuss the definitions of the concepts used, and list the main difficulties encountered in processing the data. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the respective contributions of the main databases and their complementarity in the broad framework of a countrywide corpus. They also shed light on the calculation of open access rates and thus contribute to a better understanding of current developments in the field of open science.	10.1162/qss_a_00179	Chaignon, L; Egret, D																					2022.0					10.1162/qss_a_00179			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=FRA 		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=FRA							
3243	WoS	Impact factions: assessing the citation impact of different types of open access repositories	Institutional repositories; Search engine performance; Bibliometrics; Open access citation advantage; Open access availability	Institutional repositories (IR) maintained by research libraries play a central role in providing open access to taxpayer-funded research products. It is difficult to measure the extent to which IR contribute to new scholarship because publisher self-archiving policies typically require researchers to cite the version of record of a manuscript even when an IR copy is accessed to conduct the research. While some studies report an open access (OA) citation advantage resulting from the availability of self-archived or green OA manuscripts, few have sought to measure an OA citation effect of IR separately from disciplinary repositories, including arXiv and PubMed Central. In this study, the authors present a bibliometric analysis examining correlations between search engine performance of items in IR, OA availability from different types of repositories, and citations. The analysis uses a novel, open dataset of IR access and usage derived from five months of Google search engine results pages (SERP) data, which were aggregated by the Repository Analytics and Metrics Portal (RAMP) web service. Findings indicate that making OA copies of manuscripts available in self-archiving or green repositories results in a positive citation effect, although the disciplinary repositories within the sample significantly outperform the other types of OA services analyzed. Also evident is an increase in citations when a single manuscript is available in multiple OA sources.	10.1007/s11192-022-04467-7	Wheeler, J; Pham, NM; Arlitsch, K; Shanks, JD																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-022-04467-7			44958	a=opentools	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3247	WoS	Implementation of an Open Science Instruction Program for Undergraduates	Undergraduate education; Science education; Open Science; Post-Secondary science education; Canada	The scientific, social, and economic advantages that accrue from Open Science (OS) practices-ways of doing research that emphasize reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility at all stages of the research cycle-are now widely recognized in nations around the world and by international bodies such as the United Nations and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, program wide or coordinated instruction of undergraduate students in OS practices remains uncommon. At the University of British Columbia in Canada, we have started to develop a comprehensive undergraduate OS program that can be adapted to and woven into diverse subject curricula. We report on the context and planning of the pilot module of the program, Open Science 101, its implementation in first-year Biology in Fall 2019, and qualitative results of an attitudinal survey of students following their course.	10.1162/dint_a_00086	Hanna, Sharon; Pither, Jason; Vis-Dunbar, Mathew				J		DATA INTELLIGENCE	English	Article				[Hanna, Sharon; Pither, Jason; Vis-Dunbar, Mathew] Univ British Columbia, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada		15.0	0.0	MIT PRESS	CAMBRIDGE	ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA			2021.0	3	1	150.0	161.0	10.1162/dint_a_00086	WOS:000691830400020		44958	a=openscience	m=survey	d=natscie	t=other	geo=CAN		a=openscience; a=openeducation	m=other; m=survey	d=natscie	t=other	geo=CAN		a=openscience	m=interview	d=med	t=other	geo=CAN	
3252	WoS	Importance of open science and science communication practices from the perspective of stakeholders	Open Science; Scientific communication; Mathematical methods; Statistical methods; Factor analysis; Information Science	Introduction: Composed by several movements, Open Science has been gaining considerable notoriety in the search for increasing confidence in the research results, seeking transparency in all the elements that make up a scientific investigation process. Objective: In this scenario, this article aims to analyze the importance attributed by actors involved with Open Science and its movements and initiatives. Method: A questionnaire was sent to personalities involved in the scientific process: two groups of messaging and communication applications in audio and video over the internet and a discussion list of actors interested in the topic, composed of librarians, researchers, professors and editors. Structured by 1 open question and 20 variables related to Open Science, the respondents were instructed to indicate on a 5-point Likert scale the importance of each one, observing the context of scientific communication developed at the public university. Results: With the assistance of SPSS, descriptive statistical analysis of frequency and mean were performed. In addition, a factor analysis was applied and the possibility of condensing the information into a total of four components was identified. Conclusion: Through this study, it was concluded that, in spite of alternating the frequency, the most important mode was registered for all variables, indicating that all the initiatives and movements listed in the study were considered important by the actors involved with Open Science.	10.20396/rdbci.v20i00.8670366	Ribeiro, NC; Oliveira, DA; Dias, CD; Miranda, ACD																					2022.0					10.20396/rdbci.v20i00.8670366			44958	a=openscience	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher; t=librarian	geo=BRZ	not relevant due to language criteria	a=openscience	m=survey	d=none	t=practitioner	geo=all							
3253	Scopus	Importance of the Open Data Assessment: An Insight Into the (Meta) Data Quality Dimensions		Data are the most important resource of the 21st century. The open data (OD) movement provides publicly available data for the development of a knowledge-based society. As such, the concept of OD is a valuable information technology (IT) tool for economic, social, and human development, which adds value. To further develop these processes on a global scale, users need to manage the quality of OD in their practices. Otherwise, what is the point of using data just for the sake of using it (in science or practice) without thinking about data compliance with norms, standards, and so forth? This article aims to provide an overview of (meta)data quality dimensions, sub-dimensions, and metrics used within OD assessment-related research papers. To achieve this, the authors performed a systematic literature review (SLR) and extracted data from 86 relevant studies dealing with the evaluation of OD. The article endows the progress made so far in OD assessment research. Findings of reviewing the assessment of the OD in the light of existing (meta)data quality dimensions unveil the potential of metadata. Furthermore, the analysis disclosed the need for greater use of quantitative methods in research, and metadata can greatly assist in this. © The Author(s) 2021.	10.1177/21582440211023178	Šlibar, B.; Oreški, D.; Begičević Ređep, N.

3255	WoS	Incentive or disincentive for research data disclosure? A large-scale empirical analysis and implications for open science policy	Data sharing; Open science; Data disclosure; Open data&nbsp; Policy	When researchers disclose their original data, they can enhance the visibility of their research works and gain more academic credits (credit effect). By contrast, doing so may accelerate the knowledge replacement process, which dissipates the academic credit that their research works may have received (competition effect). In this study, we examine whether and the extent to which scientists gain academic credit for their research works by publicly disclosing their data. Our review of various literature hypothesizes that data-disclosing research gains more academic credit than non-data-disclosing research in the short term. However, this difference gradually disappears and reverses as the competition effect emerges. This pattern is expected to systematically differ depending on the academic reputation of the journals where the data-disclosing research is published. We empirically test the derived hypotheses by analyzing the metadata of over 310,000 Web of Science Core Collection (WoS CC)-indexed journal articles published in 2010. Our analysis supports both hypotheses. The present study contributes to the on-going policy discussion about the need for institutional measures to promote disclosure of research data by scientists.	10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102371	Kwon, Seokbeom; Motohashi, Kazuyuki				J		INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT	English	Article				[Kwon, Seokbeom; Motohashi, Kazuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kwon, Seokbeom; Motohashi, Kazuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Tokyo, Japan; [Motohashi, Kazuyuki] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind RIETI, Tokyo, Japan		95.0	0.0	ELSEVIER SCI LTD	OXFORD	THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND	0268-4012		2021.0	60				10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102371	WOS:000684843400018		44958	a=opendata	m=document review; m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openpolicies	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3262	Scopus	Insight into Faculty Open Access Perceptions: A Quantitative Analysis among UAE Faculty	Academic publishing; faculty perceptions; library science; open access publishing; scholarship	Open access (OA) publishing presents university librarians, administrators, and faculty researchers with a paradox of both opportunities and challenges. For faculty researchers in particular, the decision of whether to pursue OA publication of their scholarship is driven by their perceptions of the credibility and quality of OA publishing. While there is a variety of extant literature broaching these perceptions, there are few quantitative analyses with an n greater than 100 respondents, and a notable lack of research in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study mitigates this gap in scholarship regarding OA publishing, offering a quantitative analysis of a survey sample of 134 UAE faculty researchers. We find statistically significant findings regarding the relationship between one’s position on OA and length of publishing career and professorial rank. Similarly, we find that those with favourable views of OA publishing are more likely to believe that OA journals are peer reviewed, increase likelihood of being cited, allow authors to repost content, and are a more principled alternative to traditional publishers. Those who believe that their research should be freely available to all readers or that OA publishing broadens their research impact were also highly likely to hold favourable views of OA publishing. Finally, our findings suggest that support for OA publishing at the departmental and institutional level remains ambiguous, with findings yielding contradicting results on the matter. The study contributes to content regarding scholarship, library science, and university administration. © 2022 The Author(s).

A systematic review of the citation of open access and subscription-based articles	article; bibliometrics; Bibliometrics; human; human experiment; Humans; language; open access publishing; Open Access Publishing; outcome assessment; practice guideline; publishing; Publishing; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review	Aims Over the last two decades, the existence of an open access citation advantage (OACA)- increased citation of articles made available open access (OA)-has been the topic of much discussion. While there has been substantial research to address this question, findings have been contradictory and inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review to compare studies of citations to OA and non-OA articles. Methods A systematic search of 17 databases attempted to capture all relevant studies authored since 2001. The protocol was registered in Open Science Framework. We included studies with a direct comparison between OA and non-OA items and reported article-level citation as an outcome. Both randomized and non-randomized studies were included. No limitations were placed on study design, language, or publication type. Results A total of 5,744 items were retrieved. Ultimately, 134 items were identified for inclusion. 64 studies (47.8%) confirmed the existence of OACA, while 37 (27.6%) found that it did not exist, 32 (23.9%) found OACA only in subsets of their sample, and 1 study (0.8%) was inconclusive. Studies with a focus on multiple disciplines were significantly positively associated with finding that OACA exists in subsets, and are less associated with finding that OACA did not exist. In the critical appraisal of the included studies, 3 were found to have an overall low risk of bias. Of these, one found that an OACA existed, one found that it did not, and one found that an OACA occurred in subsets. Conclusions As seen through the large number of studies identified for this review, OACA is a topic of continuing interest. Quality and heterogeneity of the component studies pose challenges for generalization. The results suggest the need for reporting guidelines for bibliometrics studies.

3279	WoS	Journal flipping to Open Access: The Perception of Spanish Journal Managers	Open access; OA flipping; Drivers for open access; Barriers for open access	There is a growing interest in determining the factors that influence a journal's flipping to Open Access (OA). Using semi-structured interviews combined with bibliometric indicators, this paper uncovers the perception of Spanish managers related to OA and the decision to flip. The key research questions are twofold: How well do bibliometric measures reflect the changes in the status of the journal? How do journal managers perceive the flipping process? In order to answer these, twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with journal managers of Spanish Journals. The findings suggest the great majority of managers are aware of the indicators, but only two considered they reflect their reality. The results indicate as the main motivations to flip to OA: being imposed by the host institution, economic reasons, and increase visibility and internationalization. An increase in the number of submissions, visibility, or internationalization since the transition is perceived as a benefit while the loss of interchanges with other institutions is seen as the major drawback. Although flipping to OA is perceived by the managers to have many advantages, it raises some challenges too, especially the need for funding, lack of resources capacity for technical support, and the creation of alliances.	10.1007/s12109-021-09831-8	Bautista-Puig, Nuria; Lopez-Illescas, Carmen; Moed, Henk F.

3280	WoS	Key Factors Affecting User Adoption of Open-Access Data Repositories in Intelligence and Security Informatics: An Affordance Perspective	Intelligence and security informatics; open-access data repositories; affordance theory; user technology adoption; perceived value; technology acceptance	Rich, diverse cybersecurity data are critical for efforts by the intelligence and security informatics (ISI) community. Although open-access data repositories (OADRs) provide tremendous benefits for ISI researchers and practitioners, determinants of their adoption remain understudied. Drawing on affordance theory and extant ISI literature, this study proposes a factor model to explain how the essential and unique affordances of an OADR (i.e., relevance, accessibility, and integration) affect individual professionals' intentions to use and collaborate with AZSecure, a major OADR. A survey study designed to test the model and hypotheses reveals that the effects of affordances on ISI professionals' intentions to use and collaborate are mediated by perceived usefulness and ease of use, which then jointly determine their perceived value. This study advances ISI research by specifying three important affordances of OADRs; it also contributes to extant technology adoption literature by scrutinizing and affirming the interplay of essential user acceptance and value perceptions to explain ISI professionals' adoptions of OADRs.	10.1145/3460823	Wen, B; Hu, PJH; Ebrahimi, M; Chen, SC																					2022.0					10.1145/3460823			44958	a=opentools	m=survey	d=natscie	t=practitioner	geo=USA	"not strictly academics: ""recruited [interview participants] from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)"""	a=opendata	m=survey	d=engtech	t=researcher	geo=all							
3289	WoS	Librarians as gate-openers in open access publishing: A case study in the United Arab Emirates	Open access; Scholarly publishing; Academic librarians	The advent of open access (OA) has changed the scholarly communication landscape resulting in disruption of traditional relationships between different stakeholders. Thus, the gatekeeping role of academic librarians has been impaired. However, by assuming the role of gate-openers, librarians have become facilitators of OA uptake in the United Arab Emirates. Results of the UAE librarians survey show that they are aware of OA routes and predatory journals; they are using different instruction methods to educate users on OA resources and publishing; and they harness OA resources along the traditional subscription-based products. Readers of international library journals need to be aware of efforts undertaken by their peers to advance OA mandate outside the Eastern European and North American context, often dominating scholarly communication studies.	10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102425	Boufarss, Mohamed; Harviainen, J.

3300	Scopus	LYRASIS Research and an Inclusive Approach to Open Access in the United States	LYRASIS; Open Access; Publishing Models; United States	In 2020, LYRASIS Research conducted a member survey of predominantly United States (U.S.) higher education libraries to understand the spectrum of attitudes and actions related to Open Access (OA). The results indicated that the U.S. approach to OA is decentralised, lacking the focused trends that are apparent in other areas of the world. The diversity among types of colleges and universities in the U.S. is revealed through discussions about support or lack thereof for APCs, crowdfunding models, preprint repositories, the Subscribe to Open approach, and more. The array of OA approaches that garner support in the U.S. may appear confusing as we strive for scale in our efforts. LYRASIS has used its research findings, in combination with our deep understanding of U.S. higher education librar-ies, to develop a collaborative approach towards OA that provides multiple incentives and opportunities for libraries serving all types of institutions to engage. This article, expanding on the LIBER 2021 Conference Presenta-tion of the same name, will outline the results of the survey, the conclusions LYRASIS has drawn, and our work to develop an inclusive approach to a variety of OA initiatives. Our understanding of the landscape of U.S. higher education has led us to develop or support several significant recent OA initiatives, including a fund for OA ebooks focused on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals topics and the establishment of the LYRASIS Open Access Community Investment Program (OACIP). © 2022, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

To investigate current outcomes of Open Science research, and to get a better understanding on well-researched topics and research gaps, we aimed at providing an openly accessible overview of empirical studies that focus on different aspects of Open Science in different scientific disciplines, academic groups and geographical regions. In this paper, we describe a data set of studies about Open Science practices retrieved following a PRISMA approach to compile a literature review. We included studies from the Scopus and Web of Science databases with keywords relating to Open Science between the years 2000 and 2020, as well as a snowball search for relevant articles. Studies that did not investigate any aspect of Open Science, or weren’t peer-reviewed were excluded, resulting in a total of 695 remaining studies. 	10.12688/f1000research.121665.1	Lasser, J., Schneider, J., Lösch, T., Röwert, R., Heck, T., Bluemel, C., Neufend, M., Steinhardt, I., Skupien, S.																					2022.0					10.12688/f1000research.121665.1			44960	a=openscience; a=openmethod; a=openeducation; a=openevaluation; a=openpolicies; a=opensoftware; a=opentools; a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all	datapaper as part of our survey?	a=openscience	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3317	WoS	Measuring the prevalence of open access in Canada: A national comparison	Open access publishing; scientometrics; scholarly communication; research dissemination; Canada	For two decades, open access (OA) has gained momentum worldwide. However, adoption of OA in Canada is lagging compared with other countries. Using data from Dimensions and Erudit, this paper provides an overview of OA dissemination in Canada, focusing on the effect of institutions, language, and funding. Papers in French, and from Quebec universities, are more likely to be OA, while papers from engineering-oriented institutions are less likely to be OA. Regarding funders, those in health sciences have higher OA compliance. The paper concludes discussing disciplinary differences in OA dissemination, low compliance to OA mandates in Canada, and the role of Erudit.	10.5206/cjilsrcsib.v45i1.14149	Paquet, V; van Bellen, S; Lariviere, V																					2022.0					10.5206/cjilsrcsib.v45i1.14149			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=CAN		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=CAN							
3329	Scopus	Monitoring the transition to open access through its mode of implementation: A principal component analysis of two surveys		Open access (OA) is transforming scholarly communication. Various modes of OA implementation have emerged, which reflect the complexity surrounding OA development. This study aimed to examine this development from the perspective of how OA is implemented. The sample comprised 2,368 randomly selected articles published in 2013 and 2,999 published in 2018 indexed in the Web of Science. We also conducted searches in Google and Google Scholar in 2015 for articles published in 2013 and in 2020 for articles published in 2018. Selected articles were categorized as either an “OA article,” “electronic subscription journal article,” or “not available online.” OA articles were classified into 10 implementation modes: Gold, Hybrid, Delayed, Bronze, Subject Repositories, Institutional Repositories, Personal/Institutional Websites, Academic Social Networks (ASNs), Others, and Web Aggregator. Overall, 56.5% of all sampled articles in 2013 were available for free on at least one website in 2015, while 61.7% of all sampled articles in 2018 were freely available on at least one website in 2020. Concerning implementation mode, ASNs had the highest frequency (44.4% in 2015 and 56.0% in 2020), followed by Subject Repositories (35.0% in 2015 and 39.6% in 2020) and Gold (24.1% in 2015 and 37.4% in 2020). To obtain an overview of OA implementation, we conducted principal component analysis with OA implementation mode as the variable for both 2015 and 2020. The first principal component was the axis indicating the number of overlapping OA implementations for each article in 2015 and 2020, while the second principal component was the axis orthogonal to the first, which was difficult to interpret. We identified three groups of OA implementation in each plot of the principal component scores for articles in 2015 and 2020; however, the OA implementation of each group differed in 2015 and 2020. This diversity reflects the respective positions of various stakeholders regarding OA. Copyright: © 2022 Kurata et al.

Developers of these platforms often advocate for open science on the grounds that it is in keeping with scientific values, specifically referencing Mertonian norms. However, many scientists are agnostic toward open science; as policies and technology enforce the movement's aims of sharing openly, they seek to protect the research they view as their own. My dissertation work studies the enactment of open science by a variety of stakeholders in the Open Science Framework (OSF) - its developers, its users, and also its non-users. Through interviews, trace data collection, and observation of these various populations, I will explore how these stakeholders construct different technologies-in-practice. By taking the OSF not as a given, but as a technology whose purpose and effects are structured by the constraints and resources of its stakeholders, I will unpack the tensions among open science advocates, agnostics, and their use of technology. With these insights, science policy and open systems can be designed to better accommodate the diverse concerns of stakeholders. © 2021 ACM.	10.1145/3462204.3481785	Cohoon, J.

3343	WoS	No evidence that mandatory open data policies increase error correction		An analysis of 199 journals in ecology and evolution finds no link between policies mandating data sharing and the rate of article retraction or correction. The authors position this finding in a broader discussion of open data and code. Using a database of open data policies for 199 journals in ecology and evolution, we found no detectable link between data sharing requirements and article retractions or corrections. Despite the potential for open data to facilitate error detection, poorly archived datasets, the absence of open code and the stigma associated with correcting or retracting articles probably stymie error correction. Requiring code alongside data and destigmatizing error correction among authors and journal editors could increase the effectiveness of open data policies at helping science self-correct.	10.1038/s41559-022-01879-9	Berberi, I; Roche, DG																					2022.0					10.1038/s41559-022-01879-9			44958	a=opendata; a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=natscie	t=researcher; t=publisher; t=none	geo=all		a=opendata	m=biblio	d=natscie	t=none	geo=all

3348	WoS	On Status Quo and Perspectives of Bibliometrics-Driven Open Access Services at German Universities	Bibliometrics; open access; library services	This article explores the extent to which institutional services for bibliometrics and open access at German universities relate to each other. Although recent science policies note an increasing role of data-driven decision making around open access, only a few universities make use of bibliometrics as part of their open access services. While bibliometrics services increasingly reflect ethical aspects in terms of responsible use, problematic examples can be found. Institutional activities to monitor open access benefit from standardized and networked research information as well as from collaboration within a university network.	10.1515/bfp-2021-0098	Stisser, A; Jahn, N; Schmidt, B																					2022.0					10.1515/bfp-2021-0098			44958	a=openaccess; a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=none	t=librarian; t=university; t=none	geo=GER		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=university	geo=DEU							
3350	WoS	'One size doesn't fit all': Lessons from interaction analysis on tailoring Open Science practices to qualitative research	conversation analysis; discursive psychology; interaction analysis; open data; open science; preregistration; qualitative research; replication; reproducibility	The Open Science Movement aims to enhance the soundness, transparency, and accessibility of scientific research, and at the same time increase public trust in science. Currently, Open Science practices are mainly presented as solutions to the 'reproducibility crisis' in hypothetico-deductive quantitative research. Increasing interest has been shown towards exploring how these practices can be adopted by qualitative researchers. In reviewing this emerging body of work, we conclude that the issue of diversity within qualitative research has not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, we find that many of these endeavours start with existing solutions for which they are trying to find matching problems to be solved. We contrast this approach with a natural incorporation of Open Science practices within interaction analysis and its constituent research traditions: conversation analysis, discursive psychology, ethnomethodology, and membership categorisation analysis. Zooming in on the development of conversation analysis starting in the 1960s, we highlight how practices for opening up and sharing data and analytic thinking have been embedded into its methodology. On the basis of this presentation, we propose a series of lessons learned for adopting Open Science practices in qualitative research.	10.1111/bjso.12568	Huma, B; Joyce, JB																					2022.0					10.1111/bjso.12568			44958	a=openscience	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openscience	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3354	Scopus	Open Access And Free Resources On The Internet: Awareness And Use During Covid-19 Pandemic		The Internet is a huge source of free and openly available information. However, the awareness about open source information amongst faculty and students is not known. The objective of this study is to explore the awareness and use of open access resources (OARs) by Faculty and students of Ponda Education Society’s (PES’s) colleges. A questionnaire-based survey method has been used in this research. A questionnaire was designed in Google Forms and was sent to 400 library users. A total of 278 (69.5%) library users filled in the form. The findings shows that 110 (39.6%) of respondents are not aware of the OARs and 132 (48.5%) of respondents were not aware of the COVID 19 open access resources provided by publishers and vendors during the COVID-19 crisis. Study recommends training on OARs to overcome the problems faced by library users in using OARs. The study also suggests librarians to increase awareness of OARs through information literacy sessions through orientation sessions. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.		Matonkar, P.V.; Dhuri, K.R.

3355	Scopus	Open access and predatory publishing: a survey of the publishing practices of academic pharmacists and nurses in the United States	academic publishing; nurses; Open access; pharmacists; predatory publishing; scholarly communication; tenure	Objective: Academics are under great pressure to publish their research, the rewards for which are well known (tenure, promotion, grant funding, professional prestige). As open access publishing gains acceptance as a publishing option, researchers may choose a “predatory publisher.” The purpose of this study is to investigate the motivations and rationale of pharmacy and nursing academics in the United States to publish in open access journals that may be considered “predatory.” Methods: A 26-item questionnaire was programmed in Qualtrics and distributed electronically to approximately 4,500 academic pharmacists and nurses, 347 of whom completed questionnaires (~8%). Pairwise correlations were performed followed by a logistic regression to evaluate statistical associations between participant characteristics and whether participants had ever paid an article processing fee (APF). Results: Participants who had published more articles, were more familiar with predatory publishing, and who were more concerned about research metrics and tenure were more likely to have published in open access journals. Moderate to high institutional research intensity has an impact on the likelihood of publishing open access. The majority of participants who acknowledged they had published in a predatory journal took no action after realizing the journal was predatory and reported no negative impact on their career for having done so. Conclusion The results of this study provide data and insight into publication decisions made by pharmacy and nursing academics. Gaining a better understanding of who publishes in predatory journals and why can help address the problems associated with predatory publishing at the root. © 2022, Medical Library Association.

3356	WoS	Open access and research funding in Brazil: characteristics and trends in scientific production	Open Access; Funding; Indexing; Brazil; Scientometrics	Objective: this study aims to analyze the distribution of Brazilian scientific production, considering its growth and possible relationship between indexing variables, research funding and open access modalities. It measures adherence to open access, considering the indexing databases, the presence or absence of funding, and the modalities and areas of research funding by Fapesp. Methods: the study has an exploratory character, based on a scientometric approach for the analysis of the variables of interest. It considers all original and review articles from 2009 to 2016, published by authors affiliated to Brazilian institutions. Information on funding modalities of articles resulting from research funded by Fapesp was obtained from its Virtual Library (BV Fapesp). Results: a significant increase in restricted access articles was observed on the Web of Science (WoS), in addition to a percentage increase in articles with no mention of funding. Among the open access modalities, the Bronze route stands out at the beginning of the period, giving way to Golden; and SciELO represents almost 50% in open access when there is no mention of funding, and 20% when funding is declared. The Fapesp funding modalities reveal a relationship between: scholarship levels and open access modalities, with higher level and publication in WoS, and lower level in SciELO; Regular and Biota grants have a higher percentage in SciELO, while Thematic, CEPIDs and Young Researcher in WoS. Finally, it was observed that practically all areas increase the percentage of articles in restricted access at the end of the period, with emphasis on Humanities. Conclusions: Brazilian scientific production signals that the trend towards open access is reversed among the subperiods analyzed. Fapesp's initiatives are perceived, with a favourable trend towards the Golden route, in Web of Science journals, while SciELO reinforces this trend, both in Fapesp-funded research and in production funded by other agencies, as well as in publications without mention to funding. In such circumstances, researchers from Sao Paulo institutions accredited in post-graduate programs are forced to find an intersection point, which prioritizes the Impact Factor, but often having to give up open access.	10.5007/1518-2924.2022.e78818	Mugnaini, R; Igami, MPZ; Krzyzanowski, RF																					2022.0					10.5007/1518-2924.2022.e78818			44958	a=openaccess; a=openpolicies	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=BRA		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=BRA							
3358	WoS	Open Access and Sensitive Social Sciences Data in Different Legislative Contexts: The Case of Strategic Selection Elite Interviewing in Sweden	case study; ethical inquiry; methods in qualitative inquiry; interpretive description; narrative research	Open access has moved from the periphery to the mainstream in the last few years, and most recently there have been calls to make research data accessible, useable and reusable. While there are many good arguments for this development, including that it makes the research process more transparent and enables others to re-use the data collected, it also has negative implications for social science research in certain contexts. The case addressed here is elite interviewing in the context of conducting research in Sweden. In this case there is already a strong legislative focus on openness with implications for research ethics. This suggests that open data access implementation, particularly in the context of specific legislative frameworks, needs to be reviewed to ascertain ethically correct interviewee and research subject protection in the social sciences.	10.1177/16094069221120747	Keskitalo, ECH																					2022.0					10.1177/16094069221120747			44958	a=opendata	m=document review	d=socscie	t=none	geo=SWE		a=openaccess; a=opendata	m=document review	d=socscie	t=none	geo=SWE

The drawbacks of transformative agreements, and their implications on open access are discussed. It is found that transformative agreements are largely undertaken in parts of Europe and USA. Further, they get discontinued in between and do not divulge all the terms and conditions of the agreements thus raising doubts of complete open access to journals and transparency. It concludes, such agreements may be able to raise only a small percentage of open access to published literature.

3361	WoS	Open Access Articles Garner Increased Social Media Attention and Citation Rates Compared With Subscription Access Research Articles: An Altmetrics-Based Analysis	Altmetrics; social media; impact; visualization; orthopaedics; open access	Background: To better understand the research impact on social media, alternative web-based metrics (Altmetrics) were developed. Open access (OA) publishing, which allows for widespread distribution of scientific content, has become increasingly common in the medical literature. However, the relationship between OA publishing and social media impact remains unclear. Purpose: To compare social media attention and citation rates between OA and subscription access (SA) research articles within the orthopaedic and sports medicine literature. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Articles published as either OA or SA in 5 high-impact hybrid orthopaedic journals between January 2019 and December 2019 were analyzed. The primary outcome was the Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), a validated measure of social media attention. Secondary outcomes included citation rates, article characteristics, and the number of shares on social media. Independent t tests and chi-square analyses were used to compare outcomes between OA and SA articles. A multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association between article type and AAS while controlling for bibliometric characteristics. Results: A total of 2143 articles (246 OA articles, 11.5%; 1897 SA articles, 88.5%) were included. The mean AAS among all OA articles was 62.4 +/- 184.6 (range, 0-2032), whereas the mean AAS among all SA articles was 18.4 +/- 109.8 (range, 0-3425), representing a statistically significant difference (P < .001). The mean citation rate among OA articles was significantly higher (17.0 +/- 22.5; range, 0-139) than that of SA articles (8.6 +/- 13.4; range, 0-169) (P < .001). Multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that OA status (beta = 15.15; P = .044), number of institutions (beta = 2.13; P = .023), studies classified as epidemiological investigations (beta = 107.40; P < .001), and disclosure of a conflict of interest (beta = -11.18; P = .032) were significantly associated with a higher AAS. Conclusion: OA articles resulted in significantly greater AAS and citations in comparison with SA articles. Articles published through the OA option in hybrid journals as well as those with a higher number of institutions, those that disclosed a conflict of interest, and those classified as epidemiological investigations were positively associated with greater AAS in addition to a greater number of citations. The potential for more extensive research dissemination inherent in the OA option may therefore translate into greater reach and social media attention.	10.1177/03635465221124885	Vadhera, AS; Lee, JS; Veloso, IL; Khan, ZA; Trasolini, NA; Gursoy, S; Kunze, KN; Chahla, J; Verma, NN																					2022.0					10.1177/03635465221124885			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio; m=other	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3363	WoS	Open Access Availability of India's Scientific Research Funded by National and International Agencies	Funded research; Scientific publications; Funding agencies; Open access	Funding has become the most significant element of supportive action for research that has served the research community in numerous ways to improve the advancement and development of society. Scientific research in India is funded by many public and corporate sector institutions and autonomous organisations, NGOs, and regional and international agencies. However, access to publicly funded scientific research literature has been an essential issue of debate among the advocates of the Open Access (OA) movement during the last two decades. This study maps OA availability to India's research publications funded by national and international agencies. The study applied a scientometric approach using the Scopus database to identify funding research publications available in the OA domain. The findings revealed that 570320 research articles were published by the Indian researchers during 2016-to 2020, of which 150638 (26.41 %) were produced with the financial support of different national and international funding agencies, of the funded research publications, 44166 (29.32 %) articles were freely available OA to the public with no or fewer restrictions for reuse. Most of the funded research literature is available via green mutes of OA, followed by gold and bronze OA. The study also showed that Horizon 2020 and the Ministry of Science, ICT, and future planning are the primary funding sources for researchers in India during study period. The study's findings are helpful for researchers and policymakers to promote OA availability of funded research to researchers for advancing the country's scientific progress.	10.14429/djlit.42.4.17810	Deori, M; Verma, MK; Nazim, M																					2022.0					10.14429/djlit.42.4.17810			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=IND		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=IND							
3364	Scopus	Open Access E-books in Islam: A Case Study of Directory of Open Access Books		The present study aims to explore the currents trends of open access e-books available through the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) in the subject field of Islam. The DOAB was selected as a source for data collection during July 2020. The findings reveal that 263 e-books are available on Islam, which contributes only (0.94 percent) of the total share of e-books (27,697) available in DOAB. The results reveal that the maximum number of e-books is available on Religion (111), History (42), Sociology (34), and Political Science (27). The publishing trends show that majority of these e-books were published by Transcript Verlag (28), followed by Pressess de I’ifpo (23) and Brill (18), respectively. The licensing authority reveals that the highest number of e-books (105) on Islam is available through Open Education License for Books. The linguistic assessment shows that (44.86 percent) of e-books have been published in the English language followed by French (38.78 percent) and German (12.92 percent), respectively. The majority of these books (28.51 percent) are published before 2000. In contrast, authorship trends reveal that majority of the e-books are by a single author (68.87 percent) followed by two authors (20.53 percent) and three authors (9.50 percent). The maximum number of e-books (24.71 percent) has 201-400 pages while as, (51.33 percent) of e-books do not have page numbering. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.		Ali, A.; Ahmed, A.

3365	WoS	Open access in Angola: a survey among higher education institutions	Open access; Angola; Higher education institutions; Journals; Repositories	Open access (OA) to research publications is of global relevance, both in terms of provision and consumption of scholarly content. However, much of the research, practice, and models surrounding OA have been centered around the Global North. In this study we investigate how and to what degree higher education institutions (HEIs) in Angola interact with the concept of OA to journal publications through their policies and practices, a country where the end of the civil war in 2002 marked a new start for growth in teaching and research. This study is based on an online survey conducted in 2020 among research management units of Angolan HEIs. 23 valid institutional responses were received of 44 invitations sent (52% response rate). The results suggest that Angolan HEIs have moderate awareness of OA but practical incorporation into academic processes has remained slow, however, this can be seen to be connected to the overall slow progress in ramping up research intensity in the country. Seven of the responding institutions reported to be involved in publishing scholarly journals, all of them OA. Overall Angolan HEIs have few institutional repositories, and have so far placed little value on OA in the context of academic career advancement.	10.1007/s11192-022-04410-w	Artigas, W; Gungula, EW; Laakso, M																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-022-04410-w			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=university	geo=AGO		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=unisupportstaff	geo=AGO							
3367	WoS	Open access in the context of Information Science research	Information access; Bibliometric; Librarianship; Statistics; Scientific production	Open access is a scientific dissemination mechanism that aims to democratize access to scientific research results, removing barriers to access and permission to published content. Such barriers often marginalize authors, institutions, or countries with less financial resources. In this context, this work aims to understand the world scenario of open access research, in the field of Information Science, in the last six years (2015 to 2020) and to identify possible suggestions that can improve the future of research on this subject. Bibliometric analysis was used to achieve these objectives. We used Scopus database as a source of information, combined with the SciVal tool. As a result, 1139 documents were retrieved on the open access area, and from the analyses, it was possible to characterize the sample, identify the main contributors and verify the quality of research on the open access field. We were also able to identify the main actors in the international scope, the research areas most engaged with the open access and to propose, from the complementary literature, a proposal to promote open access research through international and national collaborations among other authors.	10.1590/2318-0889202234e220016	Gaal, LPM; Martins, MS																					2022.0					10.1590/2318-0889202234e220016			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=natscie	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3368	WoS	Open access information resources and university libraries: Analysis of perceived awareness, challenges, and opportunities	Open Access; Open Science; Openness; University libraries; Punjab; Islamabad; Pakistan; Awareness of OA; Challenges of OA; Opportunities of OA	This study assesses the perceived level of Open Access (OA) awareness, challenges, and opportunities in context of university libraries of Pakistan. The differences between public and private sector university libraries in terms of their awareness, challenges and opportunities were also analyzed in this study. Survey research design, based on a structured questionnaire, was employed to meet the objectives of the study. The population of the study was libraries of Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC) recognized universities located in Punjab and Islamabad (Pakistan). The findings revealed that majority of university libraries were fully aware of HEC-National Digital Library (NDL) OA resources, OA journals, and Pakistan Research Repository, whereas, somewhat aware of Budapest OA Initiative, and Diamond OA Model. Lack of additional resources (staff, time, efforts), unreliability of OA information resources, and inadequate tools and infrastructure were identified as top challenges. However, free access, increase in library value, and fulfilling users need with shrinking budget were top three identified opportunities. The study did not find any significant statistically difference between public and private university libraries in terms of their level of awareness, perceived challenges and opportunities. This study is administered in institutional context and fills the literature gap.	10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102367	Sultan, Mussarat; Rafiq, Muhammad				J		JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP	English	Article				[Rafiq, Muhammad] Univ Punjab, Inst Informat Management, Lahore, Pakistan; [Sultan, Mussarat] Govt Punjab, Higher Educ Dept, Lahore, Pakistan		47.0	0.0	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA	0099-1333		2021.0	47	4			10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102367	WOS:000658396600002		44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=university; t=librarian	geo=PAK		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=librarian	geo=PAK

We did an exploratory study of the theme, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, and applying the documentary method. The data were collected in the DOAJ, retrieving the journals of Library and Information Science that are indexed in the filter Bibliography. Library science. Information resources, followed by a visit to each journal's website to identify descriptive characteristics. Content analysis was used to evaluate and categorize the data collected. As a result, it was verified that most of the journals retrieved in the filter do not charge Article Processing Charges (APCs), and that of those that do, a considerable portion use the 'Publishing Rates' business model with discount policies and/or fee exemptions. It is concluded that this theme has different perspectives when considering the financial sustainability of a journal, with advantages and disadvantages, mainly regarding the authors of articles to be submitted in journals that use APCs.	10.1590/1981-5344/39948	de Oliveira, AVN; Farias, MGG																					2022.0					10.1590/1981-5344/39948			44958	a=openaccess; a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=natscie	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3373	Scopus	Open access policies and mandates and their practical implementation in Spanish public universities	Access policies; Bibliometric analysis; Four dimensions; Higher education institutions; Impact indicators; Open access; Public universities; Research questions; Web of Science	This paper analyses the open access (OA) output of Spanish public universities from 2011 to 2020. A bibliometric analysis was carried out using Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science Core Collection, and a set of bibliometric analyses was performed to provide an evidence-based response to the research questions (What are the most significant initiatives for promoting open access at higher education institutions at both the national level and the institutional level? What open access contribution are Spanish public universities making? What types of open access are used the most? How does OA affect the impact of scientific production? What type of open access increases impact? Is there a relationship between funded research and open access publications of results?). The bibliometric analyses looked at four dimensions: activity indicators, OA types, impact indicators and funding. The paper concludes that the institutional measures and actions fostering OA identified in universities' policies and mandates bear a correspondence with the bibliometric data. Spanish public universities have higher rates of OA publications, with a clear preference for Green Published and DOAJ Gold publications. OA publications are systematically more cited than non-OA publications (with Green Accepted in the lead), and there is a strong relationship among visibility, funding and open access. © 2021 18th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2021.

3374	WoS	Open Access Publishing and University Researchers? Agency Towards Reshaping the Publishing Habitus	open access publishing; university researcher; habitus; agency	Drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of field and habitus, this qualitative study adopted a multiple-case design to investigate how university researchers exercised their agency as they engaged in actions of open access publishing, and how such actions influenced the researchers themselves and the university as an institution. Guided by a four-dimensional approach to agency as the conceptual framework, the study unveiled the complex processes by which university researchers played agentic roles in open access publishing and reshaped their own publishing habitus. They utilised various kinds of personal and social resources to mediate their agentic actions for the purpose of producing intended outcomes as institutionally recognised achievement. As their agentic actions influenced the university as institutional structure in terms of policy reformulation, they also reshaped university researchers' habitus in an incremental manner as their habitus was augmented to include a new form of recognised action. The study also revealed the duality of discourse, which, conforming to institutionality, both enabled and constrained researchers' agentic actions.	10.25159/1947-9417/11390	Xu, H																					2022.0					10.25159/1947-9417/11390			44958	a=openaccess	m=interview	d=hum; d=soscie	t=researcher; t=university	geo=CHN	language teaching	a=openaccess	m=interview	d=none	t=researcher	geo=all							
3375	Scopus	Open Access publishing around the globe. A two-tier study on the perspectives of international medical informatics researchers on a barrier-free communication of science	academic publishing; inner-scientific exchange; open access; science communication; survey	It is considered important or even necessary for a continuous exchange of scientific information that all relevant stakeholders can access the inner-scientific communication. The traditional publication model, however, does not provide an inclusive flow of communication but rather favours researchers affiliated with resource-strong institutions, oftentimes located in the Global North. Hence, there are increased efforts to establish an alternative, open access (OA) publication model. Since such a model can only be successful if scientists themselves support and use it, this paper presents a two-tier study examining the factors that might shape scientists’ decision (not) to choose an OA option for disseminating their own work. Based on (semi-)standardized surveys of scientific organizations and individual researchers in the field of biomedical and health informatics, it provides an overview of individual and institutional frame conditions that influence the dissemination and reception of scientific knowledge. In order to account for regional differences, it draws on a global sample, comprising respondents from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and North America. Overall, the findings provide a heterogeneous picture of how OA is perceived and practiced. Respondents appreciate the convenient way to access OA articles as readers and the opportunity to reach broader (non-academic) audiences as authors. However, due to high publication fees and concerns regarding quality and reputation, a positive attitude towards OA does not necessarily translate into willingness to choose this publication model. Especially researchers from low-income countries benefit from a barrier-free communication mainly in their role as readers and much less in their role as authors of scientific information. This is also evident at the institutional level, as OA policies or financial support through funding bodies are most prevalent in Europe and North America. These findings call for more attention to inner-scientific communication as part of (science) communication research.

3376	WoS	Open access publishing in India: trends and policy perspectives	India; Policy; Open access; Scholarly publishing; Mandates	Purpose - This study aims to analyze Open Access (OA) publishing trends and policy perspectives in India. Different aspects, such as the growth of OA journals digital repositories. the proportion of OA availability to research literature and the status of OA mandates and policies are studied. Design/methodology/approach - Data for analyzing OA trends were gathered from multiple data sources. including Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), OpenDOAR, SCimago and Web of Science (WoS) databases. DOAJ and OpenDOAR were used for extracting OA journals and digital repository data. SCImago Journal and Country ranking portal and WoS database were used to obtain Indian publication data for assessing the proportion of OA to research literature. ROARMAP was used to study OA mandates and policies adopted by universities, research institutions and research funders in India. OA mandates and policies of major regulatory bodies and funding agencies were also reviewed using secondary sources of information and related websites. Findings - India ranks number 15 and 17 globally for OA journals and OA repositories, with 317 journals and 98 repositories. Although India's proportion to OA publications is 23% (7% below the world average of 30%), the annual growth rate of OA publications is around 18%. Although the governing bodies and institutions have made efforts to mandate researchers to adopt OA publishing and self-archiving, its implementation is quite low among Indian researchers, as only three institutions (out of 18 listed in the ROARMAP) are defined the embargo period. Funding agencies in India do not provide financial assistance to authors for the payment of Article Processing Charges despite mandates that research is deposited in OA repositories. India lacks a national OA policy but plans to implement a one nation one subscription formula to provide OA to scientific literature to all its citizens. Research limitations/implications - The study has certain limitations. Because much of India's research output is published in local journals that are not indexed in WoS, the study recommends conducting further analyses of publications using Scopus and other databases to understand the country's OA publishing proportion better. A further study based on feedback from different stakeholders through a survey may be conducted for formulating a national OA policy. Originality/value - The study is the first that used multiple data sources for investigating different facets of OA publishing in India, including OA journals, digital repositories, OA research output and OA mandates and policies for publicly funded research. The finding's will be helpful for researchers and policymakers interested in promoting OA adoption among researchers worldwide.	10.1108/GKMC-09-2021-0158	Nazim, M; Bhardwaj, RK; Agrawal, A; Bano, A																					2022.0					10.1108/GKMC-09-2021-0158			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio; m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=IND		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=IND							
3377	WoS	Open Access Redefined: Survey Data and Literature Study on the Impact of Sci-Hub in Orthopaedic Research	Sci-Hub; Internet research; shadow library; open access; piracy	Background Since Alexandra Elbanyan founded Sci-Hub in 2011, the website has been used by a growing number of researchers worldwide. Sci-Hub is a so-called shadow library or guerrilla open access format bypassing publishers' paywalls, giving everyone free access to scientific papers. Until today, there have been no publications about usage by orthopaedic and trauma surgeons of Sci-Hub or other pirate sites and how it may influence their work. Materials and Methods Orthopaedic and trauma surgeons of four university hospitals in Germany and Europe were consulted using a standardised questionnaire containing multiple items about the use and evaluation of Sci-Hub. In addition, the Medline and Cochrane databases were screened for all studies related to Sci-Hub. Two reviewers independently reviewed all articles and the references of these articles. Results Of all orthopaedic surgeons consulted, 69% knew of Sci-Hub and 66.7% used it on a regular basis. Of the younger participants (< 45 years old), 77% knew the webpage, while only 25% of older participants (> 45 years old) knew the webpage. Ninety percent found the quality of their citation and research had been enhanced since using Sci-Hub. On a scale of 1 to 10, user-friendliness was rated with a mean rating of 7.58 (95% CI: 7.262-7.891). Ethical or legal concerns among users seem mixed. On a scale of 1 (no concerns) to 5 (many concerns), the mean score was 2.39 (95% CI: 2.154-2.615). Of doctors using Sci-Hub, 89% would recommend it to other colleagues. Conclusion The quality and number of articles in Sci-Hub is outstanding, and the rate of young researchers using the website is high. The most important shift in literature research for decades is a phenomenon mostly used by young researchers and is not the subject of current research itself. Sci-Hub may have already changed how orthopaedic research works.	10.1055/a-1773-1268	Gathen, M; Cucchi, D; Kabir, K; Welle, K; Jaenisch, M; Jansen, TR; Randau, TM																					2022.0					10.1055/a-1773-1268			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=med	t=researcher	geo=EU; geo=GER		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=med	t=researcher	geo=all

3383	WoS	Open access uptake in Germany 2010-2018: adoption in a diverse research landscape	Open access publishing; Scholarly communication; Empirical study; German research landscape; Open access classification	This study investigates the development of open access (OA) to journal articles from authors affiliated with German universities and non-university research institutions in the period 2010-2018. Beyond determining the overall share of openly available articles, a systematic classification of distinct categories of OA publishing allowed us to identify different patterns of adoption of OA. Taking into account the particularities of the German research landscape, variations in terms of productivity, OA uptake and approaches to OA are examined at the meso-level and possible explanations are discussed. The development of the OA uptake is analysed for the different research sectors in Germany (universities, non-university research institutes of the Helmholtz Association, Fraunhofer Society, Max Planck Society, Leibniz Association, and government research agencies). Combining several data sources (incl. Web of Science, Unpaywall, an authority file of standardised German affiliation information, the ISSN-Gold-OA 3.0 list, and OpenDOAR), the study confirms the growth of the OA share mirroring the international trend reported in related studies. We found that 45% of all considered articles during the observed period were openly available at the time of analysis. Our findings show that subject-specific repositories are the most prevalent type of OA. However, the percentages for publication in fully OA journals and OA via institutional repositories show similarly steep increases. Enabling data-driven decision-making regarding the implementation of OA in Germany at the institutional level, the results of this study furthermore can serve as a baseline to assess the impact recent transformative agreements with major publishers will likely have on scholarly communication.	10.1007/s11192-021-04002-0	Hobert, Anne; Jahn, Najko; Mayr, Philipp; Schmidt, Birgit; Taubert, Niels				J		SCIENTOMETRICS	English	Article				[Hobert, Anne; Jahn, Najko; Schmidt, Birgit] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen State & Univ Lib, Gottingen, Germany; [Mayr, Philipp] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Cologne, Germany; [Mayr, Philipp] Univ Gottingen, Inst Comp Sci, Gottingen, Germany; [Taubert, Niels] Bielefeld Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Studies Sci I2SoS, Bielefeld, Germany		60.0	0.0	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0138-9130		2021.0	126	12	9751.0	9777.0	10.1007/s11192-021-04002-0	WOS:000653118600004		44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio; m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=GER	is m=biblio the only method applied? 	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=DEU							
3388	WoS	Open data and data sharing in articles about COVID-19 published in preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv	SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Preprint server; Open data; Data sharing	This study aimed to analyze the content of data availability statements (DAS) and the actual sharing of raw data in preprint articles about COVID-19. The study combined a bibliometric analysis and a cross-sectional survey. We analyzed preprint articles on COVID-19 published on medRxiv and bioRxiv from January 1, 2020 to March 30, 2020. We extracted data sharing statements, tried to locate raw data when authors indicated they were available, and surveyed authors. The authors were surveyed in 2020-2021. We surveyed authors whose articles did not include DAS, who indicated that data are available on request, or their manuscript reported that raw data are available in the manuscript, but raw data were not found. Raw data collected in this study are published on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/6ztec/). We analyzed 897 preprint articles. There were 699 (78%) articles with Data/Code field present on the website of a preprint server. In 234 (26%) preprints, data/code sharing statement was reported within the manuscript. For 283 preprints that reported that data were accessible, we found raw data/code for 133 (47%) of those 283 preprints (15% of all analyzed preprint articles). Most commonly, authors indicated that data were available on GitHub or another clearly specified web location, on (reasonable) request, in the manuscript or its supplementary files. In conclusion, preprint servers should require authors to provide data sharing statements that will be included both on the website and in the manuscript. Education of researchers about the meaning of data sharing is needed.	10.1007/s11192-022-04346-1	Strcic, J; Civljak, A; Glozinic, T; Pacheco, RL; Brkovic, T; Puljak, L																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-022-04346-1			44958	a=opendata	m=biblio; m=survey	d=med; d=natscie	t=researcher; t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess; a=opendata	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=DEU

Because of this, it has become a policy priority in various research and development strategy plans and roadmaps, but the awareness if its potential is still limited in industry. Additive manufacturing (AM) represents a field where open science initiatives may have a great impact, as large academic and industrial communities are working in the same area, enormous quantities of data are generated on a daily basis by companies and research centers, and many challenging problems still need to be solved. This article presents a case study based on an open science collaboration project between TRUMPF Laser- und Systemtechnik GmbH, one of the major AM systems developers and Politecnico di Milano. The case study relies on an open data set including in-line and in-situ signals gathered during the laser powder bed fusion of specimens of aluminum parts on an industrial machine. The signals were acquired by means of two photodiodes installed co-axially to the laser path. The specimens were designed to introduce, on purpose, anomalies in certain locations and in certain layers. The data set is specifically designed to support the development of novel in-situ monitoring methodologies for fast and robust anomaly detection while the part is being built.

Recent reviews of open biodiversity data have clearly documented the value of data sharing, but the extent to which the biodiversity research community has adopted open data practices remains unclear. We address this question by reviewing applications of presence-only primary biodiversity data, drawn from a variety of sources beyond open databases, in the indexed literature. We characterize how frequently researchers access open data relative to data from other sources, how often they share newly generated or collated data, and trends in metadata documentation and data citation. Our results indicate that biodiversity research commonly relies on presence-only data that are not openly available and neglects to make such data available. Improved data sharing and documentation will increase the value, reusability, and reproducibility of biodiversity research.	10.1093/biosci/biab072	Mandeville, Caitlin P.; Koch, Wouter; Nilsen, Erlend B.; Finstad, Anders G.

3417	WoS	Open peer review: an analysis of scientific journals indexed in the Directory of Open Access Journals	Open peer review; Directory of Open Access Journals; Scientific journals	Objective: Open peer review is one of the evaluation models that has been discussed in the scientific literature, as it is in line with the principles of open science. Therefore, this study aims to identify the review model adopted by scientific journals indexed in the open peer review filter of the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), in order to analyze whether these journals meet the seven characteristics pointed out by Ross-Hellauer (2017a). Methods: It was based on the quanti-qualitative approach, using the exploratory method and data collection techniques: documentary research and unstructured interview. The DOAJ proceeded with the download of metadata and visits to the websites of each journal to be analyzed. The unstructured interview was carried out by e-mail and social media from the editors. For data analysis, content analysis was adopted, with the establishment of categories. Results: Most of the journals' sample comes from the United Kingdom, is under the responsibility of the BioMed Central (BMC) publisher, publishes in English, charges the payment of Article Processing Charges (APC) and covers the Health Sciences area. open and open opinions are the most adopted by the scientific journals in the sample. In addition, according to the editors, open reviews are fairer and act as a teaching tutorial on how to conduct a scientific opinion. The results also demonstrate that the open review impacts the quality of the manuscript, results in better, more constructive, less negative evaluations and acts as an alternative to value the volunteer work of the reviewers. Conclusions: It is concluded that the open review model proves to be a viable alternative and that, based on the results, it can be considered as an effective model and that provides several contributions to the peer review process, in particular, for make it more transparent and fairer.	10.5007/1518-2924.2021.e79506	de Andrade Maia, Francisca Clotilde; Guedes Farias, Maria Giovanna				J		ENCONTROS BIBLI-REVISTA ELETRONICA DE BIBLIOTECONOMIA E CIENCIA DA INFORMACAO	Portuguese	Article				[de Andrade Maia, Francisca Clotilde; Guedes Farias, Maria Giovanna] Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil		19.0	0.0	UNIV FEDERAL SANTA CATARINA	FLORIANOPOLIS	CAMPUS UNIVERSITARIO REITOR JOAO DAVID FERREIRA LIMA, FLORIANOPOLIS, SC 88010-970, BRAZIL			2021.0	26				10.5007/1518-2924.2021.e79506	WOS:000707350300023		44958	a=openevaluation	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openevaluation	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3418	Scopus	Open research data and open peer review: Perceptions of a medical and health sciences community in Greece		Recently significant initiatives have been launched for the dissemination of Open Access as part of the Open Science movement. Nevertheless, two other major pillars of Open Science such as Open Research Data (ORD) and Open Peer Review (OPR) are still in an early stage of development among the communities of researchers and stakeholders. The present study sought to unveil the perceptions of a medical and health sciences community about these issues. Through the investigation of researchers’ attitudes, valuable conclusions can be drawn, especially in the field of medicine and health sciences, where an explosive growth of scientific publishing exists. A quantitative survey was conducted based on a structured questionnaire, with 179 valid responses. The participants in the survey agreed with the Open Peer Review principles. However, they ignored basic terms like FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and appeared incentivized to permit the exploitation of their data. Regarding Open Peer Review (OPR), participants expressed their agreement, implying their support for a trustworthy evaluation system. Conclusively, researchers need to receive proper training for both Open Research Data principles and Open Peer Review processes which combined with a reformed evaluation system will enable them to take full advantage of the opportunities that arise from the new scholarly publishing and communication landscape. © 2021 by the authors.

3419	WoS	Open research data repositories: Practices, norms, and metadata for sharing images		Open research data repositories are promoted as one of the cornerstones in the open research paradigm, promoting collaboration, interoperability, and large-scale sharing and reuse. There is, however, a lack of research investigating what these sharing platforms actually share and a more critical interface analysis of the norms and practices embedded in this datafication of academic practice is needed. This article takes image data sharing in the humanities as a case study for investigating the possibilities and constraints in 5 open research data repositories. By analyzing the visual and textual content of the interface along with the technical means for metadata, the study shows how the platforms are differentiated in terms of signifiers of research paradigms, but that beneath the rhetoric of the interface, they are designed in a similar way, which does not correspond well with the image researchers' need for detailed metadata. Combined with the problem of copyright limitations, these data-sharing tools are simply not sophisticated enough when it comes to sharing and reusing images. The result also corresponds with previous research showing that these tools are used not so much for sharing research data, but more for promoting researcher personas.	10.1002/asi.24571	Hansson, Karin; Dahlgren, Anna				J		JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	English	Article				[Hansson, Karin; Dahlgren, Anna] Stockholm Univ, Dept Culture & Aesthet, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden		46.0	0.0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	2330-1635		2022.0	73	2	303.0	316.0	10.1002/asi.24571	WOS:000688067400001		44958	a=opendata	m=document review	d=hum	t=none	geo=all		a=opendata	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3421	WoS	Open research data: A case study into institutional and infrastructural arrangements to stimulate open research data sharing and reuse	Data reuse; data sharing; infrastructural arrangements; institutional arrangements; open data; open science; research data management	This study investigates which combination of institutional and infrastructural arrangements positively impact research data sharing and reuse in a specific case. We conducted a qualitative case study of the institutional and infrastructural arrangements implemented at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. In the examined case, it was fundamental to change the mindset of researchers and to make them aware of the benefits of sharing data. Therefore, arrangements should be designed bottom-up and used as a carrot rather than as a stick. Moreover, support offered to researchers should cover at least legal, financial, administrative, and practical issues of research data management and should be informal in nature. Previous research describes generic institutional and infrastructural instruments that can stimulate open research data sharing and reuse. This study is among the first to analyze what and how infrastructural and institutional arrangements work in a particular context. It provides the basis for other scholars to study such arrangements in different contexts. Open data policymakers, universities, and open data infrastructure providers can use our findings to stimulate data sharing and reuse in practice, adapted to the contextual situation. Our study focused on a single case and a particular part of the university. We recommend repeating this research in other contexts, that is, at other universities, faculties, and involving other research data infrastructure providers.	10.1177/09610006221101200	van Gend, T; Zuiderwijk, A																					2022.0					10.1177/09610006221101200			44958	a=opendata	m=document review	d=none	t=university; t=none	geo=NDL		a=opendata	m=interview	d=none	t=university	geo=NLD							
3425	WoS	Open Science and Multicultural Research: Some Data, Considerations, and Recommendations	diversity science; metascience; replication; reproducibility; rigor	Public Significance Statement Ethnic minority psychology research/cultural diversity science (EM/D) emphasizes empirical approaches that are responsive to the needs and experiences of people of color, whereas the current mainstream open science movement encourages open communications, democratic review process, and transparency of methods and data for critical scrutiny by other researchers. Findings from three studies showed that open science practices such as preregistrations, material and data sharing, and open-access publishing are not commonly adopted in EM/D, likely because of concerns about possible risks to ethnoracial minority scholars and study populations. We offer practical recommendations to bridge these gaps and suggest future directions to connect EM/D and mainstream open science movement to better understand the experiences of ethnoracial minority communities and benefit the lives of the diverse human population. Objectives: There are two potentially useful but nonintersecting efforts to help ensure that psychological science produces valid and credible information and contributes to the understanding of diverse human experiences. Whereas North American ethnic minority psychology research/cultural diversity science (EM/D) emphasizes cultural competency to yield contextualized psychological understanding of understudied and underserved minority populations, current open science (OS) approaches emphasize material and data sharing, and statistical proficiency to maximize the replicability of mainstream findings. To illuminate the extent of and explore reasons for this bifurcation, and OS's potential impact on EM/D, we conducted three studies. Method and Results: In Study 1, we reviewed editorial/publishing policies and empirical articles appearing in four major EM/D journals on the incentives for and use of OS. Journals varied in OS-related policies; 32 of 823 empirical articles incorporated any OS practices. Study 2 was a national mixed-methods survey of EM/D scholars' (N = 141) and journal editors' (N = 16) views about and experiences with OS practices. Emerged themes included beliefs about the impact of OS on scientific quality, possible professional disadvantages for EM/D scholars, and concerns about the welfare of and ethical risks posed for communities of color. In Study 3, we explored community research participants' beliefs about data sharing and credibility of science/scientists (N = 1,104). Participants were receptive of data sharing and viewed psychological science favorably. Conclusions: We provide data-driven recommendations for researchers to assemble the best tools for approaching the knowledge-production process with transparency, humility, and cultural competency.	10.1037/cdp0000541	Lui, PP; Gobrial, S; Pham, S; Giadolor, W; Adams, N; Rollock, D																					2022.0					10.1037/cdp0000541			44958	a=opendata	m=document review; m=survey	d=socscie	t=researcher; t=none	geo=USA		a=openscience	m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3426	WoS	Open science and public trust in science: Results from two studies	epistemic trust; experimental study; open science practices; science communication; survey study; trust in science	In two studies, we examined whether open science practices, such as making materials, data, and code of a study openly accessible, positively affect public trust in science. Furthermore, we investigated whether the potential trust-damaging effects of research being funded privately (e.g. by a commercial enterprise) may be buffered by such practices. After preregistering six hypotheses, we conducted a survey study (Study 1; N = 504) and an experimental study (Study 2; N = 588) in two German general population samples. In both studies, we found evidence for the positive effects of open science practices on trust, though it should be noted that in Study 2, results were more inconsistent. We did not however find evidence for the aforementioned buffering effect. We conclude that while open science practices may contribute to increasing trust in science, the importance of making use of open science practices visible should not be underestimated.	10.1177/09636625221100686	Rosman, T; Bosnjak, M; Silber, H; Kossmann, J; Heycke, T																					2022.0					10.1177/09636625221100686			44958	a=openscience	m=survey; m=other	d=none	t=other	geo=GER		a=openscience	m=survey; m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=DEU

Interviews with South Korean and Australian experts has helped to highlight the factors that either enable or limit the impact of Open Science during a public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 outbreak. The paper categorised such factors as: contextual and external; institutional and regulatory; resource-based; individual and motivational, and supplemented this categorisation with the interviewees' quotes to illustrate specific cases and examples. The institutional and regulatory factors are perceived as the most important ones by interviewees. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

3435	WoS	Open science failed to penetrate academic hiring practices: a cross-sectional study	Open science; Job advertisements; Academic institutions; Recruitment	Background and Objective: To evaluate the current hiring practices of academic institutions around the world, with regard to the mention of advertisements for Open Science (OS) in research based, faculty, and postdoctoral positions. Study Design: Cross-sectional study, using 189 global institutions from the Center for Science and Technology Leiden ranking of world universities of 2017, including the U15 Group (Canadian Research-Intensive Universities), and five self-selected supplementary institutions. Methods: The main outcome measure for our study is the level of OS in job advertisements, assessed using the Modified Open Science Modular Scheme. Results: After assessing 305 job advertisements for academic positions in 91 institutions, only 2 (0.6%) had any explicit mention of OS in their job advertisements on the Modified Open Science Modular Scheme. The sample assessed the level of open science for 39.0% Associate and/or Assistant professor positions, 30.8% Researcher and/or Postdoctoral fellow positions, and 18.7% of Tenured positions. The remaining 11.5% were for positions such as lectureship, research associate, chair, dean, director and other. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the need for increased recognition of OS as a characteristic in research-active job advertisements. As evident in the alarmingly low percentage of job advertisements that mentioned OS (0.6%), the movement towards enhanced OS profiles across academic institutions is highly encouraged. This can be achieved through increased recognition of OS in research job advertisements and demonstrating the means in which institutions promote OS such as, encouraging preprints, publishing in open access journals, and the importance of data sharing.

3443	Scopus	Open Science in Software Engineering: A Study on Deep Learning-Based Vulnerability Detection	availability; case study; Codes; deep learning; Deep learning; executability; Open science; Replicability; replicability; reproducibility; Security; Software; Testing; Training; vulnerability detection	Open science is a practice that makes scientific research publicly accessible to anyone, hence is highly beneficial. Given the benefits, the software engineering (SE) community has been diligently advocating open science policies during peer reviews and publication processes. However, to this date, there has been few studies that look into the status and issues of open science in SE from a systematic perspective. In this paper, we set out to start filling this gap. Given the great breadth of SE in general, we constrained our scope to a particular topic area in SE as an example case. Recently, an increasing number of deep learning (DL) approaches have been explored in SE, including <italic>DL-based software vulnerability detection</italic>, a popular, fast-growing topic that addresses an important problem in software security. We exhaustively searched the literature in this area and identified 55 relevant works that propose a DL-based vulnerability detection approach. This was then followed by comprehensively investigating the four integral aspects of open science: <italic>availability</italic>, <italic>executability</italic>, <italic>reproducibility</italic>, and <italic>replicability</italic>. Among other findings, our study revealed that only a small percentage (25.5&#x0025;) of the studied approaches provided publicly <italic>available</italic> tools. Some of these available tools did not provide sufficient documentation and complete implementation, making them not <italic>executable</italic> or not <italic>reproducible</italic>. The uses of balanced or artificially generated datasets caused significantly overrated performance of the respective techniques, making most of them not <italic>replicable</italic>. Based on our empirical results, we made actionable suggestions on improving the state of open science in each of the four aspects. We note that our results and recommendations on most of these aspects (<italic>availability</italic>, <italic>executability</italic>, <italic>reproducibility</italic>) are not tied to the nature of the chosen topic (DL-based vulnerability detection) hence are likely applicable to other SE topic areas. We also believe our results and recommendations on <italic>replicability</italic> to be applicable to other DL-based topics in SE as they are not tied to (the particular application of DL in) detecting software vulnerabilities.

3446	WoS	Open science practices in general and internal medicine journals, an observational study		Background As part of the Open Science movement, this study aims to analyze the current state of open access and open data policies concerning the availability of articles and raw data of the journals belonging to the category Medicine, General & Internal of the Science Citation Index Expanded. Methods Journal data sharing policies were evaluated through the following variables: possibility of manuscript storage in repositories; reuse policy; publication on a website; and statement regarding complementary material. Subsequently, an analysis of the supplementary material associated with each article was performed through the PubMed Central repository. The study reported was assessed following the STROBE guidelines for observational studies. Results This study shows that only one-third of the journals included in the category Medicine, General & Internal allow the depositing of their documents in repositories and its reuse, while approximately half of the journals agree to publish the document on a website as well as to deposit supplementary material along with the publication. However, the reality about this last variable is that only 9.5% of the articles analyzed contained supplementary material being the main journals involved, BMJ Open, JAMA Network Open, New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet and Plos Medicine. Conclusions The analysis of the opening policies of the journals concerning data availability in medical research reveals the unequal positioning of publishers towards the sharing of open data, the ambiguity regarding government policies about the obligation to deposit data and the need for ethical and standardization requirements in the typology/format of the data deposited without forgetting the important role that the researcher plays. Further studies based on journals indexed in medical databases other than Science Citation Index Expanded are needed.	10.1371/journal.pone.0268993	Tarazona-Alvarez, B; Zamora-Martinez, N; Garcia-Sanz, V; Paredes-Gallardo, V; Bellot-Arcis, C; Lucas-Dominguez, R; Vidal-Infer, A																					2022.0					10.1371/journal.pone.0268993			44958	a=openaccess; a=opendata	m=document review	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openscience	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3473	Scopus	Participatory Mapping: A Systematic Review and Open Science Framework for Future Research	mental mapping; PGIS; PPGIS; PRISMA protocol; sketch mapping	Participatory mapping emerged from a need for more inclusive methods of collecting spatial data with the intention of democratizing the decision-making process. It encompasses a range of methods including mental mapping, sketch mapping, and participatory geographic information systems. There has been a rapid increase in uptake of participatory mapping, but the multidisciplinary nature of the field has resulted in a lack of consistency in the conducting and reporting of research, limiting further development. In this article, we argue that an open science approach is required to enable the field to advance, increasing transparency and replicability in how participatory mapping research is both conducted and reported. This argument is supported by the first large-scale systematic review of the field, which identifies specific areas within participatory mapping that would benefit from an open science approach. Four questions are used to explore the sample: (1) How are different participatory mapping methods being used and reported? (2) What information is given on the data collected through participatory mapping? (3) How are participant demographics being recorded? (4) Who is conducting the research, and where is it being published? From a total of 578 academic research articles, we analyzed a stratified sample of 117. The review reveals a significant lack of reporting on key details in the data collection process, restricting the transparency, replicability, and transferability of participatory mapping research and demonstrating the urgent need for an open science approach. Recommendations are then drawn from the results to guide the design of future participatory mapping research. © 2022 by American Association of Geographers.	10.1080/24694452.2022.2065964	Denwood T., Huck J.J., Lindley S.																					2022.0					10.1080/24694452.2022.2065964			44958	a=openparticipation	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openparticipation	m=document review	d=natscie	t=none	geo=all							
3475	WoS	Paying for open access	Open access; Willingness to pay; Choice-based conjoint analysis; Pay-what-you-want; Field experiment	Open access (OA) publishing upends the traditional business model in scientific publishing by requiring authors instead of readers to pay for the publishing-related costs. In this paper, we aim to elicit the willingness to pay (WTP) of authors for open access publishing. We conduct two separate field studies with different methodological approaches in different scientific disciplines (economics and medicine). First, a choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis measures stated preferences of 243 economists in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland regarding their valuations of open access publishing in the Top 5 economics journals. Second, a field experiment at four different open access medical journals elicits authors' self-determined (Pay-What-You-Want) payments for open access publications. The results provide a plausible range of authors' valuations, given that the first study rather provides an upper bound and the second study a lower bound of authors' willingness to pay for open access publishing.

The opening of the process of research and communication of science is supported and promoted both at the international level and at the national level in many countries through science policies and actions. At present, no Open Science policy is approved at the national level in the Republic of Moldova, but there are actions, undertaken by various organizations or within some projects, that promote this concept. And recently, the national authority in the field of science policy has been concerned about the promotion of Open Science principles in the country. Policy development and implementation of Open Science principles is difficult without involving all stakeholders and without knowledge of the current situation, both in terms of technical and legislative issues, and especially in terms of awareness of the need and willingness of people to contribute to this process. In this context, we set out to carry out this study, taking into account the insufficient level of debates and analyzes on Open Science subject carried out in the Republic of Moldova. Its purpose is to determine the attitude, the level of awareness and involvement in issues related to Open Science and its elements in the Republic of Moldova, which will serve to develop Open Science policies and instruments at national and institutional levels.	10.18662/po/13.4/519	Turcan, N; Cuciureanu, G; Cujba, R; Lupu, V; Cheradi, N; Cojocaru, I																					2022.0					10.18662/po/13.4/519			44958	a=openscience; a=openaccess; a=opendata	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher; t=librarian; t=other; t=unisupportstaff	geo=MDA		a=openscience	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher; t=librarian	geo=MDA							
3478	WoS	Perceptions regarding open science appraised by editors of scholarly publications published in Spain	open science; science editors; Spain	Pillars of open science are often included within the editorial policies of scholarly journals, including policies on open access publication, availability of underlying research data, preprints and open peer review. The aim of this paper is to examine and analyse perceptions and editorial practices related to open access, preprints, open research data and open peer review, from the perspective of editors of scientific journals published in Spain, to gain an insight into editorial policies related to open science. Results and data were obtained by a combined method of online interviews and an online questionnaire. The online survey was sent to editors from journals indexed in the Dulcinea directory, which at the time of the study included 1875 academic journals. A total of 420 responses (22.4%) were obtained. The results indicated that 92% of the journals were open access journals, 2% of the journals conducted open peer review, 15% of the journals had instructions to allow archiving preprints, and out of 375 responses, only 59 journals (16%) reported having a policy on underlying research data. Based on these results, there is a trend in favour of open access, but the perceived barriers to open peer review outweighed the advantages. There is also some reluctance to allow preprints to be made available. This concern might be because editors want authors and readers to read and cite the contents published in their journals, rather than their preprint versions.	10.1002/leap.1511	Melero, R; Bote-Vericad, JJ; Lopez-Borrull, A																					2022.0					10.1002/leap.1511			44958	a=openscience	m=interview; m=survey	d=none	t=publisher	geo=ESP		a=openaccess; a=opendata; a=openevaluation	m=survey; m=interview	d=none	t=publisher	geo=ESP							
3481	WoS	Philosophers' perceptions of pay to publish and open access in Spain: Books versus journals, more than a financial dilemma	article processing charges; book processing charges; ethics; humanities; open access; peer review; philosophy; publication funding; publishing fees; scholarly communication; Spain	Pay to publish and open access have been studied extensively, but less so in disciplines such as philosophy and ethics. This study examines the habits and perceptions of researchers from these two fields in Spain. The study draws on data from a survey (completed by 201 out of 541 researchers), a public debate with 26 researchers, and 14 in-depth interviews. Our results offer some interesting insights into the criteria researchers apply when selecting publishers and journals, notably the value they place on the absence of publication fees. However, habits differ for publishing an article or a book, since payment to publish books is more widespread.

3482	Scopus	Philosophers' perceptions of pay to publish and open access in Spain: Books versus journals, more than a financial dilemma	article processing charges; book processing charges; ethics; humanities; open access; peer review; philosophy; publication funding; publishing fees; scholarly communication; Spain	Pay to publish and open access have been studied extensively, but less so in disciplines such as philosophy and ethics. This study examines the habits and perceptions of researchers from these two fields in Spain. The study draws on data from a survey (completed by 201 out of 541 researchers), a public debate with 26 researchers, and 14 in-depth interviews. Our results offer some interesting insights into the criteria researchers apply when selecting publishers and journals, notably the value they place on the absence of publication fees. However, habits differ for publishing an article or a book, since payment to publish books is more widespread. The study finds contrasting views on the market for publishing books and journals: some respondents perceived what they consider to be the commercialisation of publishing in academic journals, while others provide arguments to support the Spanish book industry. Sceptical views were also voiced on pay to publish as a funding model.

3487	WoS	Predatory and Legitimate Open Access Journals in Language and Linguistics WHERE DO THEY PART WAYS?	predatory journals; DOAJ; open access publication; Beall's list; language and linguistics	This study aimed to identify editorial features that can distinguish predatory and legitimate open access journals in the discipline of language and linguistics. Fifty-six journals from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and an equal number of journals from Beall's updated list of potential predatory journals (PPJs) were selected for a close examination. Analyses showed that these two groups of journals differed markedly in a large number of editorial features: certain publication frequencies, contact address and contact information, mean number of articles published per year, specialized focus, mean peer review time, claimed adoption of peer review, submission mode, listing of editor(s)-in-chief, relevance of their expertise, mean number of editorial board members, availability of the guide for authors and aims/scope sections, an APC for open access, mean APC, claimed indexation by DOAJ, provision of ethical guidelines and publishing policies, and presence of DOIs. Nevertheless, they did not differ significantly with regard to mean years of editorial activity, mention of average peer review time, mention of acceptance rate, mean number of editorial board members, mean number of editors, listing of editorial boards, claimed indexation by Google Scholar/ERIC/Scopus/Web of Science, COPE membership, and availability of ISSNs. These findings point to distinguishing editorial features that language and linguistics scholars need to consider when they look for legitimate open access journals to disseminate their research.	10.3138/jsp-2022-0021	Nejadghanbar, H; Hu, GW																					2022.0					10.3138/jsp-2022-0021			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=hum	t=none	geo=none		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=hum	t=publisher	geo=all							
3499	WoS	Promoting University Research Output in Ghana through Open Access Institutional Repository	Dspace; Institutional Repository; Open Access; Intellectual Output; Research Output; Ghana; University Libraries; Librarians; Social Exchange Theory	The article focuses on awareness of institutional repository (IR), and visibility of research output through IR to enhance the visibility of university research output in higher education institutions in Ghana. One hundred and fifteen librarians were selected using a quantitative methodology. Data were collected using a questionnaire, and the results were generated using descriptive statistics. The study found out that universities in Ghana mostly relied on the mediated -archiving  model during uploads of research output than self-archiving approach. Strategies to promote IR for its intended benefits include mandating academics and students to deposit intellectual content, linking publication metrics to academic promotions and aggressively enhancing awareness of the IR. Our paper concludes that information specialists need to be creative in sensitising researchers and the academic community regarding the visibility of their research output by using IR.

3501	Scopus	Providing a model for open science facilitator policies in Iran		Open science is the platform for the science or scientific outputs that need to be managed transparently from the beginning to the end and be accessible to the society. This concept covers many components incluing open research data, open scholarly communication, and open access. Furthermore, several policies have been issued to provide a proper platform for open science in countries due to the importance and upon their capacities. Thus, the purpose of this study is to provide a model for open science facilitator policies in Iran, conducted with a qualitative approach based on focus groups of researchers and experts in open science. The findings demonstrated that concerning the current country’s environment, open science policies have to consider five main categories at this stage namely identifying the nature of science, removing barriers, motivating, separating open science according to the components, and performance level. Afterward, the proposed model of the policies based on the STEEP (V) analytical model with six environmental, technological, social, economic, political, and value aspects was presented along with related policy recommendations. Considering openness and providing facilitators for the science ecosystem is essential and this should be reflected in science, technology, and innovation policies. © 2021 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

3502	WoS	Publication cultures and the citation impact of open access		Does open access (OA) to journal articles foster citations to these articles? We compare the citation impact of gold and green OA in two disciplines: Biology and Economics & Management. The empirical analysis covers all articles of these disciplines included in the Web of Science Journal Citation Reports between 2000 and 2019. We show that, controlling for confounding variables pertaining to the journals and articles, gold OA increases citations across all articles. However, the individual disciplines feature starkly different effects: a 18.3% increase in Biology, compared to a decrease by 30.9% in Economics & Management. Also Green OA leads to an increase in citations to academic research. These results are confirmed by a number of robustness checks.	10.1002/mde.3429	Eger, Thomas; Mertens, Armin; Scheufen, Marc				J		MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS	English	Article				[Eger, Thomas] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Mertens, Armin; Scheufen, Marc] German Econ Inst IW, Big Data Analyt, Cologne, Germany; [Scheufen, Marc] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany		34.0	1.0	JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD	CHICHESTER	THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND	0143-6570		2021.0	42.0	8.0	1980.0	1998.0	10.1002/mde.3429	WOS:000688214400001		44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=none		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=natscie; d=socscie	t=none	geo=all							
3505	WoS	Publishing speed and acceptance rates of open access megajournals	Open access; Scholarly publishing; Peer review; Megajournal	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to look at two particular aspects of open access megajournals, a new type of scholarly journals. Such journals only review for scientific soundness and leave the judgment of scientific impact to the readers. The two leading journals currently each publish more than 20,000 articles per year. The publishing speed of such journals and acceptance rates of such journals are the topics of the study. Design/methodology/approach Submission, acceptance and publication dates for a sample of articles in 12 megajournals were manually extracted from the articles. Information about acceptance rates was obtained using web searches of journal home pages, editorials, blogs, etc. Findings The time from submission to publication varies a lot, with engineering megajournals publishing much more rapidly. But on average it takes almost half a year to get published, particularly in the high-volume biomedical journals. As some of the journals have grown in publication volume, the average review time has increased by almost two months. Acceptance rates have slightly decreased over the past five years, and are now in the range of 50-55 percent. Originality/value This is the first empirical study of how long it takes to get published in megajournals and it highlights a clear increase of around two months in publishing. Currently, the review process in the biomedical megajournals takes as long as in regular more selective journals in the same fields. Possible explanations could be increasing difficulties in finding willing and motivated reviewers and in a higher share of submissions from developing countries.	10.1108/OIR-04-2018-0151	Bjork, Bo-Christer				J		ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW	English	Article				[Bjork, Bo-Christer] Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland		26.0	6.0	EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD	BINGLEY	HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND	1468-4527		2021.0	45.0	2.0	270.0	277.0	10.1108/OIR-04-2018-0151	WOS:000629680100002		44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=none	this could also be m=biblio?	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3506	WoS	PubMed Central as a platform for the survival of open-access biomedical society journals published in Korea	Benchmarking; Language; Publications; PubMed Central; Republic of Korea	Twenty-one years have passed since PubMed Central (PMC) launched. The present case study describes Korean editors' history of participation in PMC and their contributions to PMC. The three main turning points in the history of Korean editors' involvement with PMC were as follows: first, the production of PMC XML files and deposition starting in 2008; second, thorough evaluations of applying journals since 2014; and third, the feasibility of non-English journals being indexed in PMC starting in 2019. The importance of PMC is further shown by the fact that KoreaMed Synapse, a full-text XML database of biomedical journals in Korea that was launched in 2007, was created by benchmarking PMC. Scholarly societies or institutes publish 724 (34.2%) of the 2,119 PMC journals without embargo in June 2021. Out of those 724 journals, 127 (17.5%) are published in Korea. PMC has helped local journals receive more citations from researchers worldwide, increasing their likelihood of being indexed in international databases. The number of submissions from international researchers has increased, thereby making it possible for journals to achieve international diversity. As the best full-text platform of biomedical journals, PMC has provided an excellent opportunity for biomedical journal editors in Korea to change their journals' language to English and produce full-text JATS ( Journal Article Tag Suite) XML files. These factors have made Korea the second-ranked country in terms of no-embargo PMC journals published by academic societies or institutes.	10.6087/kcse.247	Huh, Sun				J		SCIENCE EDITING	English	Article				[Huh, Sun] Hallym Univ, Coll Med, Dept Parasitol, Chunchon, South Korea; [Huh, Sun] Hallym Univ, Coll Med, Inst Med Educ, Chunchon, South Korea		7.0	0.0	KOREAN COUNCIL SCIENCE EDITORS	SEOUL	KOREA SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY CENTER 2ND FL, 22 TEHERAN-RO 7-GIL, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 06130, SOUTH KOREA	2288-7474		2021.0	8.0	2.0	153.0	158.0	10.6087/kcse.247	WOS:000686572400004		44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=med	t=none	geo=KOR		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=KOR							
3508	WoS	Questionable Research Practices and Open Science in Quantitative Criminology	Questionable research practices; Meta-research; Open science; Reproducibility	Objectives Questionable research practices (QRPs) lead to incorrect research results and contribute to irreproducibility in science. Researchers and institutions have proposed open science practices (OSPs) to improve the detectability of QRPs and the credibility of science. We examine the prevalence of QRPs and OSPs in criminology, and researchers' opinions of those practices. Methods We administered an anonymous survey to authors of articles published in criminology journals. Respondents self-reported their own use of 10 QRPs and 5 OSPs. They also estimated the prevalence of use by others, and reported their attitudes toward the practices. Results QRPs and OSPs are both common in quantitative criminology, about as common as they are in other fields. Criminologists who responded to our survey support using QRPs in some circumstances, but are even more supportive of using OSPs. We did not detect a significant relationship between methodological training and either QRP or OSP use. Support for QRPs is negatively and significantly associated with support for OSPs. Perceived prevalence estimates for some practices resembled a uniform distribution, suggesting criminologists have little knowledge of the proportion of researchers that engage in certain questionable practices. Conclusions Most quantitative criminologists in our sample have used QRPs, and many have used multiple QRPs. Moreover, there was substantial support for QRPs, raising questions about the validity and reproducibility of published criminological research. We found promising levels of OSP use, albeit at levels lagging what researchers endorse. The findings thus suggest that additional reforms are needed to decrease QRP use and increase the use of OSPs.	10.1007/s10940-021-09525-6	Chin, Jason M.; Pickett, Justin T.; Vazire, Simine; Holcombe, Alex O.

3510	WoS	Readiness towards the implementation of open science initiatives in the Malaysian Comprehensive Public Universities	Open science; Open science readiness; Research life cycle; Open science repository; Open science policy	This research explored the readiness towards the implementation of open science initiatives in the Malaysian Comprehensive Public Universities; both quantitative and qualitative research methods were implemented. The survey questionnaire was distributed to the academic researchers and library professionals from the selected universities and a semi-structured interview was conducted with the heads of the libraries together with their deputies to complement the first method. The findings indicate that the public universities in the country were partially involved with open science, even though the term is still new to most of the participants. The Institutional Repository is the commonly known means through which these universities promote and practice open science, although only 10% to 30% of the contents were made available to the general public. However, these institutions are currently working on implementing a policy on how to operate and fully engage other aspects of the open science practices, such as open data, open collaboration, open innovation, and the likes.	10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102368	Ahmed, Mahfooz; Othman, Roslina				J		JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP	English	Article				[Ahmed, Mahfooz; Othman, Roslina] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia		32.0	0.0	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA	0099-1333		2021.0	47.0	5.0			10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102368	WOS:000693576700005		44958	a=openscience	m=survey; m=interview	d=none	t=libriarian; t=researcher	geo=MYS		a=openscience	m=survey; m=interview	d=none	t=researcher; t=librarian	geo=MYS							
3516	WoS	Replication Crisis, p-Hacking, and Open Science. An Inquiry into Questionable Research Practices in Student Projects and Impulses for the Teaching Environment	open science; replication crisis; questionable research practices; QRPs; academic teaching; final year theses; empirical projects	In recent years, there has been an intensive debate within psychology about the conclusions that should be drawn because of the replication crisis. The use of questionable research practices (QRPs) was identified as one reason for problems concerning replicability. While there are extensive studies on the prevalence of QRPs among scientists, little is known about their occurrence among students. This article presents the first large-scale survey among 1,397 psychology students in the German-speaking countries to investigate the occurrence of QRPs in student projects and the current state of academic teaching regarding the replication crisis and open science. The joint examination of teaching and the use of questionable research practices serves to provide information on how the teaching of psychology is related to the empirical approach of students. The results reveal that questionable research practices do occur in student projects, albeit with large differences in the occurrence of specific QRPs. We also found differences in the incidence of QRPs between different project types: QRP usage was most frequent in empirical internships and least frequent in master's theses. Our data suggest that the extent of reported QRPs generally decreases as students progress in their study programs. In addition, most students seem to have already come into contact with the replication crisis in teaching, mostly in methodology classes. Finally, we provide impulses for the further development of the teaching of psychology. The principles of openness, transparency, and collaboration play an important role in these recommendations, which are aimed at teaching and producing robust research from the very beginning.	10.1026/0033-3042/a000562	Brachem, J; Frank, M; Kvetnaya, T; Schramm, LFF; Volz, L																					2022.0					10.1026/0033-3042/a000562			44958	a=openscience	m=survey	d=socscie	t=other	geo=GER; geo=AUT; geo=CHE		a=openscience	m=survey	d=socscie	t=other	geo=DEU							
3517	WoS	Reported Individual Costs and Benefits of Sharing Open Data among Canadian Academic Faculty in Ecology and Evolution	data sharing; FAIR data; open science; public data archiving; reproducibility; transparency	Open data facilitate reproducibility and accelerate scientific discovery but are hindered by perceptions that researchers bear costs and gain few benefits from publicly sharing their data, with limited empirical evidence to the contrary. We surveyed 140 faculty members working in ecology and evolution across Canada's top 20 ranked universities and found that more researchers report benefits (47.9%) and neutral outcomes (43.6%) than costs (21.4%) from openly sharing data. The benefits were independent of career stage and gender, but men and early career researchers were more likely to report costs. We outline mechanisms proposed by the study participants to reduce the individual costs and increase the benefits of open data for faculty members.	10.1093/biosci/biab024	Soeharjono, Sandrine; Roche, Dominique G.

3519	Scopus	Research Information Systems and Ethics relating to Open Science	CRIS; Current research information systems; ethics committees; infraethics; research ethics; research information management; research infrastructures; research integrity	Current research information systems (CRIS) evaluate research performance and are intended to contribute to the continuous improvement of research. Based on former research on the ethical dimensions of CRIS, our paper presents the results of a survey with a small sample of representatives of ethics committees from different European countries on ethical aspects of CRIS. Ethics committees and experts are rarely associated with CRIS-related projects. However, their opinion on ethical indicators and the implementation and use of a CRIS is undoubtedly essential for the future development and management of these systems. Against this background, our purpose is to provide a deeper understanding of the ethical aspects in the field of research information management, to show how CRIS represent ethical dimensions of scientific research and to suggest some adjustment of their development, implementation and use. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

3521	WoS	Researchers' perception and response to the open access resources (OAR) in higher learning institutions of Tamil Nadu, India	Open access resources; OA; User perception; Research scholars; OAR; Open access use	Purpose The purpose of this study is to report the results of a survey conducted at Bharathidasan and Alagappa Universities to determine the research scholars' awareness, use of Open Access (OA) resources, reasons for using, impact of OA on the research scholars' research, satisfaction and problems faced. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a self-assessed questionnaire was developed to collect data from the research scholars pursuing their research degrees from Bharathidasan and Alagappa Universities of Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 400 research scholars from various disciplines responded were used for analysis. Findings The results indicated that the majority of research scholars aware of few OA resources to a large extent and afraid to redistribute the sources as they fear of copyright issues. Easy to use, more informative and global research at one place were the major reasons for accessing the resources. The research scholars were aware of OA features and OA's impact such as freedom to use, modify, resources available with source code, reliability, self-archiving, quick publishing, more citations etc. Delay in downloading and lack of computer terminals to access the resources were the major issues faced by the research scholars. On the whole, the researchers are considering OA model as an alternative to business model and expect the university librarians to promote and enhance the accessibility of OA resources. Practical implications The outcomes of the results will enable the librarians and authorities in universities to formulate appropriate decisions to remove the issues faced by the research scholars and develop a framework for new literacy instructions. Originality/value The study undertaken is new to the Indian continent and the Tami Nadu state in particular. The findings of the study will be useful to improve the awareness level and use of OA resources effectively.	10.1108/LM-02-2022-0012	Mangai, G; Ganesan, P																					2022.0					10.1108/LM-02-2022-0012			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=IND		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=IND							
3522	WoS	Researchers' Perceptions and Experiences with an Open Access Subvention Fund		Objective - This study investigated researchers' perceptions of open access publishing and the ways in which the university's open access subvention fund could evolve to meet the campus community's needs. Methods - In spring 2021, two librarians conducted an anonymous survey using a convenience sample to recruit participants. The survey was directly distributed to 113 University of Idaho (U of I) affiliates who had received funding from, or expressed interest in, the open access subvention fund during the previous three years (FY 2019 to FY 2021). Other U of I affiliates were also offered the opportunity to participate in the survey via a link shared in the U of I's daily email newsletter as well across the U of I's graduate student email list. The researchers received 42 usable survey responses. The survey included 26 closed and open-ended questions and analysis included cross-tabulations based on fund applicant status as well as respondent role. Of the 26 questions, 4 were modified from a colleague's previous study with U of I faculty members (Gaines, 2015). Results - Survey responses showed that interest in and support for open access were common among respondents. Although a majority of respondents had published an open access journal article and would like to continue to publish open access in the future, only 17% agreed that they had departmental support to do so. Results also demonstrated that researchers were less willing to pay article processing charges (APCs) out-of-pocket and preferred for funding to come from grant budgets first, followed by Office of Research Budgets, department or college budgets, and library budgets. Respondents expressed support for many of the open access subvention fund's current criteria and processes, but they also indicated an interest in establishing a more equitable fund distribution cycle and allowing researchers to seek pre-approval once their article was accepted for peer-review. Findings related to open access publishing perspectives built upon previous research conducted at the U of I (Gaines, 2015) and across other institutions. Conclusion - This study confirmed the importance of evaluating and assessing library programs and services to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of campus communities. Through the study results, the researchers demonstrated that respondents were interested in open access publishing and the continuation of the open access subvention fund, as well as offering the U of I an opportunity to adjust the open access subvention fund's processes to better serve researchers. These results also highlighted the need for those involved in open access publishing support to investigate new open access advocacy and education efforts to ensure that researchers receive the philosophical and financial support they need to pursue different models of scholarly publishing.	10.18438/eblip30015	Doney, J; Kenyon, J																					2022.0					10.18438/eblip30015			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher; t=other	geo=USA		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=USA

As part of COST Action ""DARTER"", a network of researchers in the field of RNA therapeutics, we have performed a small survey among our members and their colleagues to assess their opinion on the subject of publishing contradictory or ambiguous results and their attitude to open access (OA) publishing. Our survey indicates that, although researchers highly value publication of ""negative""results, they often do not publish their own, citing lack of time and the perception that those results may not be as highly cited.

A qualitative methodology was used, through a semi-structured interview. The results identify the researchers' doubts regarding the fulfilment of Open Science's premises. The systematization of their ideas allows us to question if they are prepared for these new experiences in the field of science and if they have the skills to ensure their autonomy to identify where to publish, how to publish, how to manage scientific data, how to disseminate research results, how and why to choose formal and informal channels of science, how to use technologies for the benefit of their visibility and, finally, how to ensure the perennity of their scientific production. Also, the new language used in Open Science raises many difficulties for researchers. Creating training programs for researchers is a strategic goal for the implementation process of this science paradigm.

3525	Scopus	Researchers' Trends, Intentions, and Awareness, Towards Publications in Open Access	blended publishing models; gold OA; green OA; Open-Access (OA) publication	This study examined Israeli researchers' trends, intentions and awareness regarding scientific publications in open access (OA) journals and repositories. A survey was distributed to 202 Israeli researchers. According to the findings, most researchers used a combination of closed (traditional/toll access) journals with OA gold/green routes. Researchers showed low awareness of OA key concepts, which was significantly associated with the tendency not to publish in OA. In addition, researchers who reported that there was a formal policy concerning publishing articles in high-impact journals in their department tended to publish less in OA. The most common reasons that caused researchers not to publish in OA routes were lack of funding and lack of awareness. Conclusions present a need for an OA's declared policy as well as financial and informational support. 85th Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology | Oct. 29 – Nov. 1, 2022 | Pittsburgh, PA.

3529	WoS	Results of the implementation of the open access policy of the Horizon 2020 program and the prospects for the Horizon Europe program	Open Science; Open Access; Horizon 2020 Programme; Open Access policy; monitoring indicators; Horizon Europe Programm; impact-based evaluation	In recent years, the open science and, specifically, the open access to scientific publications and research data have been topics of interest for the international scientific community, including the European Union and its member states. Recently, this interest has been amplified by the development and launch of the Horizon Europe framework program and national research and innovation programs. For our country, the National Strategy for Research, Innovation and Intelligent Specialization 2022-2027, recently adopted, includes the two topics among its specific objectives. In this context, the paper analyzes the results obtained by the Horizon 2020 program in the implementation of the open access policy for publications and research data generated by its own projects, as highlighted in the final program monitoring report. The provisions of the model grant agreement regarding open access and the pilot dedicated to open research data are presented. The typology of monitoring indicators is detailed and the main indicators and their values are listed. Some conclusions drawn from the accumulated experience, with the aim of improving this activity in Horizon Europe, are reviewed. For this program, the focus on impact-based evaluation of its results is also highlighted. This approach is illustrated by short-, medium-and long-term impact monitoring indicators specific to open science.	10.33436/v32i3y202201	Neagu, G																					2022.0					10.33436/v32i3y202201			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=EU	Not to be included because article is in Romanian						with respect to method I am not quite sure, as the abstract isn't clear about it and my Romanian is somewhat rusty						
3531	WoS	Rethinking the open access citation advantage: Evidence from the reverse-flipping journals		Although the open access citation advantage (OACA) has been discussed extensively, scholars lack a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which switching from subscription-based model to open access (OA) model affects the citation impact of a scholarly journal. Many journals have switched from subscription to OA, yet they later also flipped their preswitching articles (i.e., those under subscription model) to OA, thus leaving no subscription article to be compared with their postswitching OA counterparts. To detect the switching effect, our study instead focused on 60 journals that reverse flipped from OA to subscription. We use a difference-in-difference (DiD) analytical framework to analyze two propositions related to OACA, based on the bibliographic and citation data of pre- and postswitching publications in these journals. Our findings indicate that reverse flipping is unlikely to affect the journals' impact through changing the visibility of their articles. Instead, it could lead to a systematical shift in the submissions to the journals and thus considerably affect their impact. Our findings have important theoretical and practical implications for subsequent studies, funding agencies, and scholarly journals considering a reverse flip.	10.1002/asi.24699	Ming, W; Zhao, ZY																					2022.0					10.1002/asi.24699			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3536	WoS	Role in Contribution to Open-Access Repository by the Northeast Universities in India: A Case Study of Shodhganga	ETDs; OpenDOAR; Shodhganga; INFLIBNET; North East States; Theses	Every institution needs repositories for storing, organizing, and presenting digital content, as well as maintaining digital resources for long-term digital access. The authors discussed India's OpenDOAR status, a quality-assured listing of open-access repositories globally, with a particular emphasis on the Shodhganga repository. The focus of this paper is on universities in Northeast India that deposit Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) in the Shodhganga repository. This study depicts repositories in India since their inception. The Northeastern states are given special treatment by the Central Government and INFLIBNET in the form of Planners (Promotion of Library Automation and Networking in North Eastern Region). The study's main goals are to disclose the knowledge outcome as well as the knowledge gap that exists in this geographical location. The study helps determine the number of universities in Northeast India that follow the University Grants Commission (UGC) Minimum Standards & Procedure for Award of M.Phil. / Ph.D. Degree, Regulation, 2009, which mandated that electronic version of Theses be uploaded to the Shodhganga repository for the benefit of scholars across the country.	10.14429/djlit.41.6.17027	Esh, Manash; Ghosh, Saptarshi				J		DESIDOC JOURNAL OF LIBRARY & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	English	Article				[Esh, Manash; Ghosh, Saptarshi] Univ North Bengal, Raja Rammohunpur 734014, India		18.0	0.0	DEFENCE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION DOCUMENTATION CENTRE	DELHI	METCALFE HOUSE, DELHI 110054, INDIA	0974-0643		2021.0	41.0	6.0	448.0	454.0	10.14429/djlit.41.6.17027	WOS:000719148800006		44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=IND		a=openaccess	m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=IND

Out of all the resources, an attempt has been made to place a focus on COVID-19 research repository maintained at NDLI platform to facilitate related research activities for envisaging experiments by scientists and researchers. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on COVID-19 research repository assimilated by NDLI, and a detailed investigative research has been made about various resources and materials available for research community. The official website of NDLI (direct link of NDLI website: https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/) has been referred for collection of requisite data for study. The collected information has been presented through eight tables, two charts and two figures, which have further been analyzed and interpreted to attain the objectives. Findings - The brief examples in this paper indicates that a wealth of OARs related to COVID-19 such as scholarly communications, data sets, documents and videos and journals and conferences, etc. are available for access and research by scientists and researchers to expand their research during and also beyond this global crisis. Social distancing has forced academics to displace to online platform fram physical deliverables. Institutions are forced to adopt new technologies for delivering education in online mode such as online teaching, online access of educational resources, online conferences, webinais and a host of such related activities, NDLI has been instrumental in this journey by accumulating providing research materials through its platform. Originality/value - In addition to the blended learning process, this paper provides a structured overview about COVID-19 research repository facilitated by NDLI to provide access about related research activities by scientists and researchers. This investigative research on NDLI platform has been done originally by the author with a sacrosanct aim to help serious academia and has a high referral value for the scientific, technocratic and realistic researchers with deep thrust on availability of all materials under one roof, i.e. NDLI.	10.1108/DLP-08-2021-0072	Singh, S																					2022.0					10.1108/DLP-08-2021-0072			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=IND		a=openaccess	m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=IND

3543	WoS	Scholarly open access journals in medicine: A bibliometric study of DOAJ	Medical journals; OA journals; Directory of OA journals; Open access movement; Medicine; Bibliometrics	This study aims to present a quantitative analysis of open access (OA) journals in the field of medicine indexed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The bibliographic data for this study was extracted from DOAJ and inserted into an Excel sheet for analysis. The retrieved data was analyzed by using different quantitative techniques to disclose the findings. The findings disclosed that 3627 OA journals related to the field of medicine are indexed in DOAJ, which represents a substantial increase from just 8 in 2002. Moreover, most of the medical journals (n = 1874 or 51.7%) do not charge any Author Processing Charges (APC) from the authors. The United Kingdom leads the world with 878 (24%) open access journal titles, whereas English is the top language of publication with 3149 (86.8%) OA journals in medicine. Elsevier is the leading publisher with 236 (6.5%) journal titles. A majority of the journals (n = 1595 or 44%) follow a double blind, peer-review process. About 2046 (56.4%) journals publish their contents under the Creative Commons (CC BY) licensing model to enable access and use of scholarly content for educational purposes.	10.1016/j.acalib.2022.102516	Sheikh, A; Zahra, AQ; Richardson, J																					2022.0					10.1016/j.acalib.2022.102516			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3548	WoS	Share the code, not just the data: A case study of the reproducibility of articles published in the Journal of Memory and Language under the open data policy	Open data; Reproducible statistical analyses; Reproducibility; Open science; Meta-research; Journal policy	In 2019 the Journal of Memory and Language instituted an open data and code policy; this policy requires that, as a rule, code and data be released at the latest upon publication. How effective is this policy? We compared 59 papers published before, and 59 papers published after, the policy took effect. After the policy was in place, the rate of data sharing increased by more than 50%. We further looked at whether papers published under the open data policy were reproducible, in the sense that the published results should be possible to regenerate given the data, and given the code, when code was provided. For 8 out of the 59 papers, data sets were inaccessible. The reproducibility rate ranged from 34% to 56%, depending on the reproducibility criteria. The strongest predictor of whether an attempt to reproduce would be successful is the presence of the analysis code: it increases the probability of reproducing reported results by almost 40%. We propose two simple steps that can increase the reproducibility of published papers: share the analysis code, and attempt to reproduce one's own analysis using only the shared materials.	10.1016/j.jml.2022.104332	Laurinavichyute, A; Yadav, H; Vasishth, S																					2022.0					10.1016/j.jml.2022.104332			44958	a=opendata; a=policy; a=openmethod	m=document review	d=hum	t=none	geo=all		a=openmethod	m=other	d=socscie	t=none	geo=all							
3549	WoS	Should open access lead to closed research? The trends towards paying to perform research	Open access; Article processing charges; Scientific publishers; Gold journals; Hybrid journals	Open Access (OA) emerged as an important transition in scholarly publishing worldwide during the past two decades. So far, this transition is increasingly based on article processing charges (APC), which create a new paywall on the researchers' side. Publishing is part of the research process and thereby necessary to perform research. This study analyses the global trends towards paying to perform research by combing observed trends in publishing from 2015 to 2020 with an APC price list. APC expenses have sharply increased among six countries with different OA policies: the USA, China, the UK, France, the Netherlands, and Norway. The estimated global revenues from APC among major publishers now exceed 2 billion US dollars annually. Mergers and takeovers show that the industry is moving towards APC-based OA as the more profitable business model. Research publishing will be closed to those who cannot make an institution or project money payment. Our results lead to a discussion of whether APC is the best way to promote OA.	10.1007/s11192-022-04407-5	Zhang, L; Wei, YH; Huang, Y; Sivertsen, G																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-022-04407-5			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review; m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=CHN; geo=USA; geo=GBR; geo=FRA; geo=NLD; geo=NOR		a=openaccess	m=other	d=none	t=publisher	geo=all							
3552	Scopus	Situation of open access and APC payments in Colombia. An analysis model applicable to Latin America [Situación del acceso abierto y los pagos por APC en Colombia. análisis aplicable a Latinoamérica]	Apc; Article processing charges; Colombia; Open access; Universities	Open access is fundamental to understanding scientific communication from the last three decades, especially in Latin America. Open-access growth has provoked dramatic changes in the business models of the publishing industry, mainly due to the golden route. Among those changes, the Article Processing Costs (APC) has emerged and consolidated thanks to the open movement and to research evaluation and incentives policies promoted by universities and governments. It is necessary to understand APC better and supply data and transparency on the APC payments. This article proposes a six-step methodology to analyze APC in any university, but using a sample of Colombian universities as a case study. The results show how the universities have been producing a higher share of open-access documents, but they have also faced rising expenditure on processing articles charged by publishers. © 2022 CSIC.

3556	Scopus	Social dimension activates the usage and academic impact of Open Access publications in Andean countries: a structural modeling-based approach		Most of the altmetric research in developing countries is descriptive and has not tested models exploring relationships among article-level factors. Therefore, there is a knowledge gap on this issue. The research question for this study was the following: Social dimension is the factor that activates the usage and citation of Open Access publications in Andean countries. DOIs of Andean countries publications in PLoS journals were downloaded using (n = 3,186) using rplos, an Application Programming Interface (API) developed for R: Bolivia (n = 121), Chile (n = 1,180), Colombia (n = 826), Ecuador (n = 266), Peru (n = 622), and Venezuela (n = 171). Data modeling was carried out with Partial Least Squares – Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The hypothesized structural model accounted for at least 41% of the explained variance of citations (R2 = 0.406). Among the two associated factors, the usage made the highest contribution (at least 0.639), while the social media showed a negative contribution. The application of PLS-SEM for modeling the information-seeking behavior, at the document level, highlights the positive evidence for the path social → usage → citation, but a negative and nonsignificant association between the social dimension and citation. © The Author(s) 2020.	10.1177/0266666920901849	Vílchez-Román, C.; Huamán-Delgado, F.; Alhuay-Quispe, J.

3558	WoS	Societal impact of university research in the written press: media attention in the context of SIUR and the open science agenda among social scientists in Flanders, Belgium	Science communication; Societal impact; Science popularization; Content analysis; Research evaluation; Open science	Transferring scientific knowledge to non-academic audiences is an essential aspect of the open science agenda, which calls for scholars to pursue a popularization of their research. Accordingly, purposefully introducing scientific insights to the public at large is almost univocally deemed commendable. Indeed, in today's models of research evaluation, the objects and activities considered are being extended beyond peer-reviewed journal articles to include non-scholarly popular communication. Although altmetrics offer one instrumental way to count some interactions with lay audiences, their reliance on social media makes them susceptible to manipulation, and mostly reflect circulation among niche audiences. In comparison, attention from non-scholarly media like newspapers and magazines seems a more relevant pathway to effectuate societal impact, due to its recognition in qualitative assessment tools and its broad, societal reach. Based on a case study of social scientists' attention by newspapers and magazines in Flanders (northern Dutch-speaking region of Belgium) in 2019, this paper highlights that frequent participation in the public debate is reserved for high-status researchers only. Results show highly skewed media appearance patterns in both career position and gender, as eight male professors accounted for almost half of all 2019 media attention for social scientists. Because media attention is highly subject-dependent moreover, certain disciplines and fields offer easier pathways to popularization in media than others. Both the open science agenda and research assessment models value presence of researchers in popular media, adding written press attention to existing evaluation assessments however would disproportionately disadvantage early career researchers and exacerbate existing inequalities in academia.	10.1007/s11192-022-04374-x	Jonker, H; Vanlee, F; Ysebaert, W																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-022-04374-x			44958	a=openscience	m=document review	d=socscie	t=none	geo=BEL	not sure OS here is more science communication = exclude?	a=openparticipation	m=document review	d=socscie	t=none	geo=BEL

This research starts with the normality hypothesis, the homoscedasticity hypothesis, and the robust hypothesis and uses the R language to simulate and analyze the original data of 100 studies in Estimating the Reproducibility of Psychological Science to explore the influence of the premise hypothesis on statistical methods on the reproducibility of psychological research. The results indicated the following: (1) the answer to the question about psychological studies being repeatable or not relates to the fields to which the subjects belonged, (2) not all the psychological variables meet the normal distribution hypothesis, (3) the t-test is a more robust tool for psychological research than the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and (4) the robustness of ANOVA is independent of the normality and variance congruence of the analyzed data. This study made us realize that the repeatable study factors in psychology are more complex than we expected them to be.	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905977	Zhang, WQ; Yan, S; Tian, B; Fei, DZ																					2022.0					10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905977			44958	a=opendata; open method	m=other	d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=all		a=openmethod	m=other	d=socscie	t=none	geo=all

Despite its manifold benefits, the interest and willingness of Malaysian researchers to share their research data are noticeably low. Likewise, Malaysia has not performed well in recent international open data assessments. Hence, The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) addressed the Malaysia Open Science Platform (MOSP) as one of the key strategies in National Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy 2021-2030. This study aimed to determine the organizational enablers that facilitate the delivery of MOSP strategic management by employing three qualitative approaches: literature review, desk research and semi-structured interview. This study determined leadership, people and cooperation as soft enablers while technology and systems as hard enablers. The change and stakeholder management were proposed as success factors in delivering these variables. A strategic framework was also presented as a foundation for MOSTI in formulating a robust and comprehensive strategy. © 2022 IEEE.	10.1109/TEMSCON-ASPAC52831.2022.9916546	Krishnan U., Rahim N.A., Mohamed Z.B., Salim F.B.																					2022.0					10.1109/TEMSCON-ASPAC52831.2022.9916546			44958	a=openscience; a=openpolicies	m=document review; m=interview	d=none	t=policy; t=none	geo=MYS		a=openscience	m=document review; m=interview	d=none	t=unisupportstaff	geo=MYS							
3568	WoS	Strategies to Increase the Number of Open Access Journals: The Cases of Elsevier and Springer Nature	journal portfolio; merger; collaboration; Elsevier; Springer Nature	In recent years, major commercial publishers have strengthened their presence in both the subscription journal market and the open access journal market. Examining 447 journals from Elsevier and 550 from Springer Nature, this study investigates three strategies for enlarging the number of gold open access journals: the launch of new journals, mergers with other publishers, and partnerships with research institutes. The results reveal that these publishers adopted different strategies for expanding their journal portfolios. While Springer Nature relied significantly on merging with established publishers, Elsevier recently launched many new journals independently. Approximately 60 per cent of Springer Nature journals and 45 per cent of Elsevier journals are published on behalf of research institutes. Therefore, collaboration with research institutes has contributed to the increasing number of journal titles. As major publishers expand their open access businesses, it is necessary to monitor their activities from a policy perspective of pro-competition.	10.3138/jsp.53.2.02	Asai, S																					2022.0					10.3138/jsp.53.2.02			44958	a=openaccess; a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=none	t=publisher; t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=publisher	geo=all							
3571	Scopus	Subscription-based and open access dermatology journals: the publication model dilemma	dermatology; journals; open-access; publication model; subscription-based	Medical journalism and the dissemination of peer-reviewed research serve to promote and protect the integrity of scholarship. We evaluated the publication models of dermatology journals to provide a snapshot of the current state of publishing. A total of 106 actively-publishing dermatology journals were identified using the SCImago Journal Rankings (SJR) citation database. Journals were classified by publication model (subscription-based and open-access), publishing company, publisher type (commercial, professional society, and university), MEDLINE-indexing status, and SJR indicator. Of these, 65 (61.32%) dermatology journals were subscription-based and 41 (38.68%) were open-access. In addition, 59 (55.66%) journals were indexed in MEDLINE and most were subscription-based (N=51) and published by commercial entities (N=54). MEDLINE-indexing status was significantly different across publisher types (P<0.001), access-types (P<0.001), and the top four publishers (P=0.016). Distribution of SJR indicator was significantly different across publisher types (P<0.001) and access-types (all journals, P=0.001; indexed journals only, P=0.046). More than 91% of MEDLINE-indexed titles were published by commercial entities, and among them, four companies controlled the vast majority. Discontinuation of access to any one of the top publishers in dermatology can significantly and disproportionately impact education and scholarship. © 2022 Dermatology Online Journal.

3575	WoS	Survey on Open Science Practices in Functional Neuroimaging	Data sharing; fMRI; Metascience; Neuroimaging; Open science; Preregistration; Research methods; Replication; Reproducibility; Robustness; Validity	Replicability and reproducibility of scientific findings is paramount for sustainable progress in neuroscience. Preregistration of the hypotheses and methods of an empirical study before analysis, the sharing of primary research data, and compliance with data standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), are considered effective practices to secure progress and to substantiate quality of research. We investigated the current level of adoption of open science practices in neuroimaging and the difficulties that prevent researchers from using them. Email invitations to participate in the survey were sent to addresses received through a PubMed search of human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that were published between 2010 and 2020. 283 persons completed the questionnaire. Although half of the participants were experienced with preregistration, the willingness to preregister studies in the future was modest. The majority of participants had experience with the sharing of primary neuroimaging data. Most of the participants were interested in implementing a standardized data structure such as BIDS in their labs. Based on demographic variables, we compared participants on seven subscales, which had been generated through factor analysis. Exploratory analyses found that experienced researchers at lower career level had higher fear of being transparent and researchers with residence in the EU had a higher need for data governance. Additionally, researchers at medical faculties as compared to other university faculties reported a more unsupportive supervisor with regards to open science practices and a higher need for data governance. The results suggest growing adoption of open science practices but also highlight a number of important impediments.	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119306	Paret, C; Unverhau, N; Feingold, F; Poldrack, RA; Stirner, M; Schmahl, C; Sicorello, M																					2022.0					10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119306			44958	a=openscience; a=opendata; a=open method	m=survey	d=med	t=researcher	geo=all		a=opendata; a=openmethod	m=survey	d=med	t=researcher	geo=all							
3576	Scopus	Surveying the Audience Effect in Open Peer Review of a Software Engineering Workshop	Audience Effect; Open Review; Peer Review; Review Quality; Social Behavior	Context: Even though Open Peer Review (OPR) is one of the pillars of Open Science, informed discussions are still necessary to understand its impact on the social behavior of reviewers and the quality of reviews. Goal: The main goal of this study is to understand the audience effect on reviewers' behavior and reviews' quality from the perspectives of reviewers and authors of a Software Engineering (SE) workshop. Method: We performed a survey with the workshop participants, including authors and experienced reviewers in the SE field. Results: Our results show that while the OPR model did not change the reviewers' behavior, it reinforced reviewers to avoid hostile comments and help the authors improve their manuscript. Results also show that reviewers were comfortable with revealing their identities and reviews. Finally, both reviewers and authors agreed that although the OPR model did not increase the quality of reviews, it encouraged reviewers to think more carefully about scientific issues, contributing to the writing of evidence-supported feedback. Conclusions: Open Peer Review is innovative in interacting with reviewers and authors in Brazilian SE academic venues. OPR is also inspiring, given the potential for reinforcing positive reviewers' behaviors. However, the thematic still requires further investigation and attention from the community. © 2022 ACM.	10.1145/3555228.3555271	Felizardo K., Flach C., Pereira R., Oliveirajr E.																					2022.0					10.1145/3555228.3555271			44958	a=openevaluation	m=survey	d=eng	t=researcher	geo=BRA		a=openevaluation	m=survey	d=engtech	t=researcher	geo=BRA

In this movement, practices that seek to facilitate the sharing of research artifacts are considered. Possible artifacts include articles, data, scripts, and processes. In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a survey on open science carried out in the context of the State University of Maringá (UEM) in Brazil. Such a survey is aimed at investigating the degree of knowledge about open science from lecturers who supervise Master's degree students and PhD candidates. The university has currently 54 graduate programs, distributed in different centers, encompassing almost 900 lecturers. We collected data using a web questionnaire with 22 questions. In total, 90 lecturers answered our survey. Results show that a significant subset of respondents never heard about open science, whereas the complementary subset barely dealt with the open science principles, tools or license types. We then provide in this paper a set of assumptions on several open science-related subjects. In addition, this paper might be used to guide any other university to measure the degree level of open science knowledge and to provide a plan to inspire the institutionalization of such an extremely relevant scientific topic. © 2022 ACM.	10.1145/3555051.3555064	Oliveirajr E., Cordeiro A., Nascimento D.																					2022.0					10.1145/3555051.3555064			44958	a=openscience	m=survey	d=all	t=researcher	geo=BRA		a=openscience	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=BRA

Consequently, there is a growing recognition of the need to share data, methods, algorithms, and infrastructure to make scientific research more effective, efficient, open, transparent, reproducible, accessible, and usable by different users. However, Earth Observations (EO) Open Science is still undervalued, and different challenges remains to achieve the vision of transforming EO data into actionable knowledge by lowering the entry barrier to massive-use Big Earth Data analysis and derived information products. Currently, FAIR-compliant digital repositories cannot fully satisfy the needs of EO users, while Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) are not fully FAIR-compliant and have difficulties in handling Big Earth Data. In response to these issues and the need to strengthen Open and Reproducible EO science, this paper presents SwissEnvEO, a Spatial Data Infrastructure complemented with digital repository capabilities to facilitate the publication of Ready to Use information products, at national scale, derived from satellite EO data available in an EO Data Cube in full compliance with FAIR principles. © 2021 The Author(s).	10.5334/dsj-2021-022	Giuliani, G.; Cazeaux, H.; Burgi, P.-Y.; Poussin, C.; Richard, J.-P.; Chatenoux, B.

Here, development of open science training for food science students and professionals began with 11 guided interviews of 15 beneficiaries in a European project aiming to build a 'food cloud' of datasets and services (FNS-Cloud, H2020 No. 863059). Discussions covered what partners want to learn, how they prefer to learn, and who are their ideal trainers. Inductive coding of interview transcripts with NVivo 12 qualitative analysis software revealed an inclination for technical training with a focus on data. Face-Toface learning and on-demand elearning offered by younger scientists were preferred methods and trainers. Most interviewees also talked about 'food cloud'-specific fears and desires. These interviews are now the foundation of three well received elearning courses and two workshop series supporting the value of user input in early course development decisions. © HEAd 2022.

This article aims to identify the perception of 206 participants of an international Open Education (OE) program and to contribute to UNESCO's (2019) recommendations for OE and science, with possibilities for technological enablers. The guiding questions in this study were: what are the challenges, cases, and experiences that participants perceive as drivers of OE? In what ways can technologies enable OE within the framework of UNESCO recommendations? A parallel mixed method was carried out with an initial phase analyzing qualitative and quantitative data with a perception instrument applied to the participants. The second phase comprises a literature search to locate research that uses technologies in OE and to provide an outline of technological enablers. The results were: (a) the greatest perceived challenges are Promoting the culture of open access and Promoting international cooperation; (b) 46 contributions from participants with cases to promote OE stand out and (c) contribution of six research studies to promote UNESCO's recommendations with technologies and (d) a classification scheme of technological enablers 4.0 for education is proposed. This article is intended to be of interest to educational communities, ministries of education and science, researchers, and trainers interested in educational innovation.	10.5944/ried.25.2.33088	Gonzalez-Perez, LI; Ramirez-Montoya, MS; Garcia-Penalvo, FJ																					2022.0					10.5944/ried.25.2.33088			44958	a=openeducation; a=openscience	m=document review; m=survey	d=none	t=researcher; t=none	geo=LA; geo=ESP; geo=IND; geo=USA		a=openeducation	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=all

3591	WoS	The citation impact of the Open Access accounting journals that appear on Beall's List of potentially predatory publishers and journals	Citation impact; CiteScore; Google Scholar; Journal rankings; Predatory journals; Scopus	Although there are at least six dimensions of journal quality, Beall's List identifies predatory Open Access journals based almost entirely on their adherence to procedural norms. The journals identified as predatory by one standard may be regarded as legitimate by other standards. This study examines the scholarly impact of the 58 accounting journals on Beall's List, calculating citations per article and estimating CiteScore percentile using Google Scholar data for more than 13,000 articles published from 2015 through 2018. Most Beall's List accounting journals have only modest citation impact, with an average estimated CiteScore in the 11th percentile among Scopus accounting journals. Some have a substantially greater impact, however. Six journals have estimated CiteScores at or above the 25th percentile, and two have scores at or above the 30th percentile. Moreover, there is considerable variation in citation impact among the articles within each journal, and high-impact articles (cited up to several hundred times) have appeared even in some of the Beall's List accounting journals with low citation rates. Further research is needed to determine how well the citing journals are integrated into the disciplinary citation network-whether the citing journals are themselves reputable or not.	10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102484	Walters, WH																					2022.0					10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102484			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=socscie	t=none	geo=all							
3592	Snowball	The connection of open science practices and the methodological approach of researchers		The Open Science movement is gaining tremendous popularity and tries to initiate changes in science, for example the sharing and reuse of data. The new requirements that come with Open Science poses researchers with several challenges. While most of these challenges have already been addressed in several studies, little attention has been paid so far to the underlying Open Science practices (OSP). An exploratory study was conducted focusing on the OSP relating to sharing and using data. 13 researchers from the Weizenbaum Institute were interviewed. The Weizenbaum Institute is an interdisciplinary research institute in Germany that was founded in 2017. To reconstruct OSP a grounded theory methodology (Strauss in Qualitative Analysis for Social Scientists, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1987) was used and classified OSP into open production, open distribution and open consumption (Smith in Openness as social praxis. First Monday, 2017). The research shows that apart from the disciplinary background and research environment, the methodological approach and the type of research data play a major role in the context of OSP. The interviewees’ self-attributions related to the types of data they work with: qualitative, quantitative, social media and source code. With regard to the methodological approach and type of data, it was uncovered that uncertainties and missing knowledge, data protection, competitive disadvantages, vulnerability and costs are the main reasons for the lack of openness. The analyses further revealed that knowledge and established data infrastructures as well as competitive advantages act as drivers for openness. Because of the link between research data and OSP, the authors of this paper argue that in order to promote OSP, the methodological approach and the type of research data must also be considered.	10.1007/s11135-022-01524-4	Steinhardt, I., Bauer, M., Wünsche, H., Schimmler, S.																					2022.0					10.1007/s11135-022-01524-4			44960	a=openscience; a=opendata	m=interview	d=hum; d=soscie; d=natscie	t=researcher; t=other	geo=GER		a=opendata	m=interview	d=none	t=researcher	geo=DEU

This study analyzed the moderating effect of references on the motivation of collective intelligence on open innovation from 2003 to 2006 and 2013 to 2016, considered to be the digital transformation era. The Scopus database on open and closed access journals was used for ordinary regression analysis. During the 2003-2006 period, only papers in closed access journals demonstrated sufficient effect of collective intelligence and reference on open innovation and the effective moderating role of reference. However, between 2013 and 2016, papers in open and closed access journals demonstrated the incentive effects of collective intelligence and references on citation and the moderating role of references on the correlation between collective intelligence and citation. The increase in digital transformation strengthens the collective intelligence and references of open access journals, and citations of open access journals nearly surpass those of closed access journals.	10.3390/su14052574	Yun, JJ; Liu, Z; Jeong, E; Kim, S; Kim, K																					2022.0					10.3390/su14052574			44958	a=openaccess; a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3596	WoS	The effect of data sources on the measurement of open access: A comparison of Dimensions and the Web of Science		With the growing number of open access (OA) mandates, the accurate measurement of OA publishing is an important policy issue. Existing studies have provided estimates of the prevalence of OA publications ranging from 27.9% to 53.7%, depending on the data source and period of investigation. This paper aims at providing a comparison of the proportion of OA publishing as represented in two major bibliometric databases, Web of Science (WoS) and Dimensions, and assesses how the choice of database affects the measurement of OA across different countries. Results show that a higher proportion of publications indexed in Dimensions are OA than those indexed by WoS, and that this is particularly true for publications originating from outside North America and Europe. The paper concludes with a discussion of the cause and consequences of these differences, motivating the use of more inclusive databases when examining OA, especially for publications originating beyond North America and Europe.	10.1371/journal.pone.0265545	Basson, I; Simard, MA; Ouangre, ZA; Sugimoto, CR; Lariviere, V																					2022.0					10.1371/journal.pone.0265545			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3597	WoS	The effect of Open Access on scientometric indicators of Russian economic journals	scientific journal; open access; scientometric indicators; Russian economic journals; bibliometric analysis; scientific; productivity; citation indicators	Numerous publishers view the Open Access (OA) model as one of the ways to strengthen journals'position. Enhancing the visibility of publications is believed to increase research productivity. The paper explores the impact of OA on scientometric indicators of Russian economic journals. The theoretical basis is comprised of the data management approaches and scientometric management. The methods of scientometrics, bibliometrics and comparative analysis were applied. The paper looks at the main scientometric indicators used in the Science Index ranking: journal impact factor, self-citation rate, authors' h-index, and the share of downloads. The data for analysis were retrieved from the eLibrary platform. The sample of the study includes open and closed access Russian economic journals from the list of the Higher Attestation Commission (HAC). The results obtained indicate that scientometric indicators of OA journals are higher than those of subscription-based journals, while there are no significant differences between periodicals with paid and free publications. We have found that the OA model does not guarantee an increase in scientometric indicators: most of the titles in the sample are characterised by unstable scientific positions. The research demonstrates the opportunities for using scientometric and bibliometric analyses in the strategic management system of a scientific journal aimed at improving its academic reputation.	10.29141/2218-5003-2022-13-4-6	Chernova, OA																					2022.0					10.29141/2218-5003-2022-13-4-6			44958	a=openaccess; a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=socscie	t=none	geo=RUS		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=socscie	t=none	geo=RUS							
3598	Scopus	The emerging complexity of Open Science: assessing Intelligent Data Openness in Genomic Anthropology and Human Genomics		In recent decades, the scientific community has become aware of the importance of science being effectively open in order to speed up scientific and technological progress. In this context, the achievement of a robust, effective and responsible form of data sharing is now widely acknowledged as a fundamental part of the research process. The production and resolution of human genomic data has steadily increased in recent years, mainly due to technological advances and decreasing costs of DNA genotyping and sequencing. There is, however, a downside to this process due to the huge increase in the complexity of the data and related metadata. This means it is advisable to go beyond traditional forms of sharing analysis, which have focused on data availability only. Here we present a pilot study that aims to complement a survey on the availability of data related to peer-reviewed publications with an analysis of their findability, accessibility, useability and assessability (according to the “intelligent data openness” scheme). Sharing rates in genomic anthropology (73.0%) were found to be higher than human genomics (32.4%), but lower than closely related research fields (from 96.8% to 79.2% for paleogenetics and evolutionary genetics, respectively). We discuss the privacy and methodological issues that could be linked to this finding. Comparisons of sharing rates across a wide range of disciplines has suggested that the idea of human genomics as a forerunner for the open data movement should be questioned. Finally, both in genomic anthropology and human genomics, findability and useability were found to be compliant with the expectations of an intelligent data openness, whereas only a minor part of studies met the need to make the data completely assessable. © 2021, Istituto Italiano di Antropologia.

3604	WoS	The green, gold grass of home: Introducing open access in universities in Norway		In this paper, we investigate how open access is reflected and implemented in all Norwegian universities and how they responded to national policy developments for open access in the period 2009-2021. We analyse how the universities adapted arguments for the three core missions of the universities-research, education, and societal impact-when they reacted to increasing pressures to facilitate open access. Our analysis is based on 182 institutional strategy documents, open access policies and annual reports. When considering the profile of the institutional policies and the explicit referrals to national policies, we find there is a great deal of homogeneity between Norwegian universities, and they are mostly aligned with national policy. Open access is connected to the third mission in all university strategies, but often in a very general manner and without documenting benefits for non-academic users. We find limited emphasis on open access as advantageous for education. All universities show commitment to open access, and several can be described as proactive as they tie it to different types of local incentives. Development over time suggests more mature and institutionalised polices that do not challenge what we may call the academic heartland and its core value of academic freedom, including where and how to publish. We propose a framework for analysing similar institutionalisation processes with three main dimensions: mimesis, adaptation/integration with existing practices, and maturation/commitment.	10.1371/journal.pone.0273091	Wenaas, L; Gulbrandsen, M																					2022.0					10.1371/journal.pone.0273091			44958	a=openaccess; a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=none	t=university; t=none	geo=NOR		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=NOR							
3606	WoS	The impact of open access on knowledge production, consumption and dissemination in Kenya's higher education system	Open access (OA); higher education; politics of knowledge production; publication in Africa	Open access (OA) journal publishing is presented in the literature as both an opportunity for and a threat to academics, authors and higher education systems. Institutions with information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure have enabled their academics to freely retrieve accessible content in various disciplines, which in turn increases the rate and quality of publications from these institutions. Using semi-structured interviews with Kenyan faculty, students and librarians and with Kenyan and non-Kenyan publishers, as well as secondary sources, this article examines perspectives often overlooked in this debate. The paper concludes that while OA is considered an important initiative that could enhance knowledge production and consumption in Kenya, it nevertheless presents its own challenges, which should not be overlooked. OA is not a simple solution to individual and institutional challenges or systemic epistemic injustices, which lead to poor-quality knowledge circulating via some OA platforms and have the potential to dampen the global competitiveness of knowledge produced in Kenya and other countries in the Global South.	10.1080/01436597.2022.2056010	Mwambari, D; Ali, FA; Barak, C																					2022.0					10.1080/01436597.2022.2056010			44958	a=openaccess	m=interview; m=document review	d=none	t=researcher; t=none	geo=KEN		a=openaccess	m=interview	d=none	t=researcher; t=librarian; t=other	geo=KEN

Through an analysis of seven world regions and nine scholarly fields, we found that, while the overall share of open access journals has increased significantly over the last two decades, there are important differences across both the analyzed world regions and disciplines. We also found that, with the exception of neuroscience, the proportion of open access journals is considerably lower among the journals ranked in the Q1 quartile of Scopus than in the general field. We also offer a model that explains the development of open access publishing trends on different disciplinary and geographical levels.	10.1007/s12109-021-09814-9	Demeter, Marton; Jele, Agnes; Major, Zsolt Balazs				J		PUBLISHING RESEARCH QUARTERLY	English	Article				[Demeter, Marton] Univ Publ Serv, 2 Ludovika Sq, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Jele, Agnes; Major, Zsolt Balazs] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary		45.0	0.0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES	1053-8801		2021.0	37.0	3.0	364.0	383.0	10.1007/s12109-021-09814-9	WOS:000654236300002		44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=socscie AND d=hum	t=none	geo=AF AND geo=NA AND geo=AS AND geo=EU AND geo=SA		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3614	WoS	The long-term influence of Open Access on the scientific and social impact of dental journal articles: An updated analysis	Open access; Dentistry; Bibliometrics; Altmetrics; Evidence-based dentistry; Research waste	Objectives: To investigate whether dental journal articles that are Open Access (OA) receive greater citation counts and higher Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) than articles that are non-OA in the long term. Methods: Eligible dental journal articles published in 2013 were identified via PubMed, and Web of science, Unpaywall and corresponding URLs were manually checked to determine the OA status of each included article 7 years after publication. Citation counts were extracted from Web of Science and Scopus, and AAS was harvested from the Altmetric Explorer. Multivariable general linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between OA and citation count, as well as between OA and AAS. Results: Among the 755 included articles, 309 (40.9%) were freely available online. Among the 309 OA articles, articles available from publishers accounted for 64.4% (199/309) of all OA articles, and those available through self-archiving accounted for 56.0% (173/309). According to regression analyses, OA articles had significantly greater citation counts (P = 0.001) and AAS (P < 0.001) than non-OA articles. Conclusions/clinical significance: In the field of dentistry, about 41% of journal articles are OA 7 years after publication, and OA articles available from the publishers are more common than those from authors through self-archiving. OA articles tend to have greater scientific and social impact than non-OA articles in the long term.	10.1016/j.jdent.2022.104067	Yu, XQ; Meng, ZY; Qin, DC; Shen, CY; Hua, F																					2022.0					10.1016/j.jdent.2022.104067			44958	a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all

Recent initiatives aim to improve access to research as well as methodological rigor via transparency and openness. We sought to determine the impact of such initiatives on open access publishing in the sub-area of human electrophysiology and the impact of open access on the attention articles received in the scholarly literature and other outlets. Data for 35,144 articles across 967 journals from the last 20 years were examined. Approximately 35% of articles were open access, and the rate of publication of open-access articles increased over time. Open access articles showed 9 to 21% more PubMed and CrossRef citations and 39% more Altmetric mentions than closed access articles. Green open access articles (i.e., author archived) did not differ from non-green open access articles (i.e., publisher archived) with respect to citations and were related to higher Altmetric mentions. These findings demonstrate that open-access publishing is increasing in popularity in the sub-area of human electrophysiology and that open-access articles enjoy the “open access advantage” in citations similar to the larger scientific literature. The benefit of the open access advantage may motivate researchers to make their publications open access and pursue publication outlets that support it.

3623	WoS	The practical implementation of open access policies and mandates in Spanish public universities	Open Access; Spanish Universities; Scientific publications; Spain	This paper analyses the open access (OA) production of Spanish public universities from 2011 to 2020 to achieve the following objectives: (i) to identify and analyse policies, strategies and mandates for the promotion of open access; (ii) to analyse practices related to open access of scientific publications, (iii) to explore methodologies that allow identifying variables related to open access of publications. The procedure followed consists of three phases: first, the Spanish regulation on open access is analysed; second, bibliometric techniques are applied to obtain a series of indicators related to open access of publications indexed in the web of science core collection; third, a statistical analysis based on a classification tree of variables is proposed. The results obtained show that the institutional measures and actions to promote OA identified in the policies and mandates of the universities correspond to the bibliometric data. Spanish public universities have higher rates of OA publications, with a clear preference for Green Published and DOAJ Gold publications. OA publications are systematically more cited than non-OA publications (with Green Accepted in the lead), and there is a strong relationship between visibility, funding and open access. It has also been observed that the variables that best predict whether the percentage of OA publications of a university is above average are: the proportion of publications in DOAJ Gold, the impact received by Hybrid publications and the percentage of documents in the Bronze way.	10.1007/s11192-021-04261-x	De Filippo, D; Manana-Rodriguez, J																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-021-04261-x			44958	a=openaccess AND a=openpolicies	m=biblio AND m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=ESP		a=openaccess	m=biblio; m=document review	d=none	t=university	geo=ESP							
3625	Scopus	The Presentation of Intellectual Property Pattern of Open Access Medical Journals (Iran)		Intellectual property is necessary in the flourish of research, development, and science as well as technology promotion in the new Internet and digital spaces. The key purpose of the protection of intellectual property is to prevent abuse and plagiarism, to encourage scientists and authors to conduct scientific research and literary activities, and to make their results accessible to the scientific community. Compliance with the codes of ethics, intellection, and human rights are the reason for the application of the laws of intellectual property rights at the national and international levels. The present study is an applied-exploratory study and a quantitative-qualitative research. The researcher-made questionnaire (content analysis and Delphi panel) consists of five main components (publisher, author, publications, subject, and commercialization) and 63 questions. Questionnaires were sent to the statistical population of the study, which was all the open access medical journals. About 611 completed questionnaires were entered into spss24 software. Validity and reliability, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and finally presentation of the model with PLS software were examined on the questionnaires. As can be seen from the findings, Cronbach’s alpha values, composite reliability, and average variance are statistically acceptable. In addition, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for most factors is greater than 0.7. Therefore, it is inferred that the variables have acceptable reliability. The AVE value is calculated for the components, with almost all variables having an acceptable convergent validity. The results show that there is a significant difference between the components. Considering the obtained results, it can be concluded that there is a relationship between the factors and intellectual property of journals. The quality indicators of the model confirmed this correlation as well. Finally, the results show that the questionnaire can be used with open access medical journals to examine intellectual property. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.		Giti, A.; Zarei, A.; Bayat, B.

3626	WoS	The Price of Publishing: An Investigation of the Open Access Landscape in Plastic Surgery		Background: Open access publishing in plastic surgery has rapidly gained traction in the past decade. This study investigated the digital landscape of plastic surgery open access publishing. Methods: This was a cross-sectional bibliometric investigation of plastic surgery-focused journals. Three publication models were investigated: subscription-only journals, hybrid journals offering both paywalled and open access publishing, and open access-only journals. Results: Eighty-two journals were investigated. In 2010, open access journals comprised 18 percent of all plastic surgery journals online, subscription journals comprised 79 percent, and hybrid journals comprised 3 percent. Conversely, in 2020, open access journals comprised 55 percent of all journals, hybrid journals comprised 45 percent, and there were no subscription-only journals. Multivariable linear regression adjusting for article type/content demonstrated that open access articles from hybrid journals [beta coefficient, 1.3; F(4, 18) = 790; p = 0.05] and high-quality open access journals [beta coefficient, 0.9; F(4, 19) = 738; p = 0.04] were significantly positively associated with number of full-text views. Although impact factor and article processing charges were positively correlated [Pearson correlation coefficient: r(25) = 0.39, p = 0.04] for open access publishing, some high-quality open access journals were found to offer fee waivers/free publishing. Lastly, level of evidence offered by articles from open access versus hybrid journals differed. Conclusions: Overall, this study highlighted important distinctions between trustworthy and predatory journals offering open access publishing in plastic surgery. Open access publishing in trustworthy sources offers greater visibility and is not necessarily cost-prohibitive, but some open access journals can be limited in scope (i.e., less coverage of subspecialty topics) and quality of content. Study findings were used to generate recommendations for navigating open access publishing in plastic surgery.	10.1097/PRS.0000000000009016	Yesantharao, PS; Long, C; Sacks, JM; Lee, GK; Nazerali, RS																					2022.0					10.1097/PRS.0000000000009016			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3629	Scopus	The Role of Open Science Practices in Scaling Evidence-Based Prevention Programs	Evidence-based programs; Home visiting; Open science; Scaling	The goal of creating evidence-based programs is to scale them at sufficient breadth to support population-level improvements in critical outcomes. However, this promise is challenging to fulfill. One of the biggest issues for the field is the reduction in effect sizes seen when a program is taken to scale. This paper discusses an economic perspective that identifies the underlying incentives in the research process that lead to scale up problems and to deliver potential solutions to strengthen outcomes at scale. The principles of open science are well aligned with this goal. One prevention program that has begun to scale across the USA is early childhood home visiting. While there is substantial impact research on home visiting, overall average effect size is.10 and a recent national randomized trial found attenuated effect sizes in programs implemented under real-world conditions. The paper concludes with a case study of the relevance of the economic model and open science in developing and scaling evidence-based home visiting. The case study considers how the traditional approach for testing interventions has influenced home visiting’s evolution to date and how open science practices could have supported efforts to maintain impacts while scaling home visiting. It concludes by considering how open science can accelerate the refinement and scaling of home visiting interventions going forward, through accelerated translation of research into policy and practice. © 2021, The Author(s).	10.1007/s11121-021-01322-8	Supplee L.H., Ammerman R.T., Duggan A.K., List J.A., Suskind D.																					2022.0					10.1007/s11121-021-01322-8			44958	a=openmethod AND a=opendata AND a=opencode	m=other	d=socscie	t=none	geo=USA	or m=document review?

3630	WoS	The Role of Publons in the Context of Open Peer Review	Academic publishing; Clarivate; Mandatory; Open peer review; Sustainable peer review; Transparency	Publons was a peer reviewer rewards platform that aimed to recognize the contribution that academics made during peer review to a journal. For about 10 years of its existence, Publons became the most popular service among peer reviewers. Having gained traction and popularity, Publons was purchased in 2017 by Clarivate Analytics (now Clarivate), and many academics, journals and publishers invested time and effort to participate in Publons. Using Publons, various peer review-related experiments or pilot programs were initiated by some academic publishers regarding the introduction of open peer review into their journals' editorial processes. In this paper, we examine pertinent literature related to Publons, and reflect on its benefits and flaws during its short-lived history. In mid-August 2022, Clarivate fused Publons into the Web of Science platform. Publons, as a brand peer review service, has now ceased to exist but some of the functionality remains in Web of Science while other aspects that used to be open and free at Publons are now paid-for services. We reflect on the effect of such experiments, which initially had bold and ambitious academic objectives to fortify peer review, on academics' trust, especially when such projects become commercialized.	10.1007/s12109-022-09914-0	da Silva, JAT; Nazarovets, S																					2022.0					10.1007/s12109-022-09914-0			44958	a=openevaluation  	m=biblio	d=none	t=publisher	geo=all	Literature Review; no empirical study??	a=openevaluation	m=document review	d=none	t=publisher	geo=all	not empirical?

This paper examines ASNS within the context of open access by suggesting that the framework of gray open access best describes ASNS as sites for the dissemination of published research. To understand why authors share their work on ASNS, this paper reviews library and information science literature, finding trends around desire to expand their works' reach, appreciation of the ease of using ASNS, lack of knowledge regarding copyright restrictions, and desire to share only the final published version of their work. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues academic libraries can take to address the growth of ASNS as de facto repositories.	10.1080/07317131.2022.2125679	Taylor, J																					2022.0					10.1080/07317131.2022.2125679			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all	Literature Review; no empirical study??	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all	literature review = not empirical?						
3633	Scopus	THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CROWDFUNDING MODEL FOR SCHOLARLY OPEN ACCESS BOOKS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LIBRARIANS [ODRŽIVOST MODELA SKUPNOG FINANCIRANJA ZNANSTVENIH KNJIGA U OTVORENOM PRISTUPU IZ PERSPEKTIVE KNJIŽNIČARA]	academic books; crowdfunding model; Open Access; Open Access books; Open Access monographs	Purpose. This paper aims to present the results of a research on the sustainability of the crowdfunding model for scholarly Open Access (OA) books from the perspective of libraries. Librarians’ motivations to financially support publishing of scholarly OA books via crowdfunding are examined, with the focus on identifying the challenges librarians are currently facing and any additional factors that contribute to their decisions to participate in crowdfunding initiatives. Methodology. The research was conducted through an anonymous online survey consisting of 9 questions. Two questions focused on the institutional role of librarians in the context of OA services and the disciplinary focus of their institution, while the other 7 questions focused on their reasons for participation/non-participation in crowdfunding initiatives and their perceptions of the challenges of publishing scholarly books OA. The questionnaire was constructed in the context of the main research question (What factors contribute to the sustainability of crowdfunding models?), which is further specified by several sub-questions (1. What are the main reasons for librarians’ participation in crowdfunding models?; 2. What global and local factors do librarians consider crucial for the sustainability of the crowdfunding model for OA books?; 3. What are currently the biggest challenges with OA book publishing according to librarians?). Findings. This study revealed that librarians believe in OA as a fundamental principle, despite existing obstacles and challenges. The research sharpens the picture compared to previously published papers because it has identified the importance of the OA principle as a key factor in the decision to support OA in relation to a specific business model, i.e., when it comes to the crowdfunding model and when it comes to academic books. The research has also found that local data on the use of academic OA books are not crucial for deciding on the participation of libraries in crowdfunding initiatives, while the author’s affiliation and disciplinary orientation of books published OA have a greater impact on librarians’ propensity to support crowdfunding models. Limitations. The research instrument (online survey) could not check whether the respondents answered the questions exclusively in the context of OA books. It can be assumed that some respondents may have answered questions about OA books based on their experiences with OA business models in the context of OA journals, while the emphasis in this research is exclusively on OA books, and specifically on the crowdfunding model (this was clearly communicated to all participants). Originality/value. Although there is a lot of research on the impact of OA, especially on the impact and sustainability of scholarly journals published OA, very few studies focus on how scholarly OA books are funded, and particularly on innovative funding initiatives involving libraries and involving crowdfunding. This research deepens the understanding of the crowdfunding model in the context of scholarly books published OA and reveals the key factors contributing to its sustainability from librarians’ perspective. © 2022, Hrvatsko Knjiznicarsko Drustvo.

3636	WoS	The Use of Open Access by Medical Librarians in Nigeria: A Survey of Knowledge and Practices	Open Science; OA; Open Access Management; Scholarly Communication; Medical Libraries; Health Science Librarians	Open access (OA) publications on the Internet are increasing and assuming important routes for disseminating scholarly information. Consequently, Open access management has become an inescapable feature of modern library services. The study examined knowledge of open access models, licensing types, resources, and practices in medical libraries in Nigeria. Questionnaire was the instrument for data collection. Participants were Fifty-one librarians from thirty-six medical libraries. Result shows high (e '' 72.5 percentage) awareness of open access green, gold, hybrid models, creative commons and public domain licensing types. However, less than half understand the full meaning and implementations of the models. Understanding was higher for OA licensing types. There was also high awareness of OA databases and resources but low use of the resources for information services. Open access services offered by the respondents are creating links to open access databases on library websites and directing patrons to OA publications. The study concludes that medical librarians need to improve their knowledge and skills of open access management to enable them build diverse collections that are relevant to Medical library patrons in the digital age.

Our case study reviews the impact on the Community of Learning for African PhD Fellows, a capacity-building project supporting PhD fellows in Sub-Saharan Africa. It builds on an analysis of data from learning analytics, surveys, and semi-structured interviews. Our case study findings indicate that course completion was low, in course offering rounds with and without online certification. Main hurdles to completion are lack of time and lack of direct career benefits or academic value attached to the course completion. We found that, while open access online courses are appreciated by PhD fellows, the implementation of open microcredentials did not provide an incentive towards completion of online courses for this population. Hard and soft copy certificates at this point are more appreciated.	10.1080/02680513.2022.2072721	van de Laar, M; West, RE; Cosma, P; Katwal, D; Mancigotti, C																					2022.0					10.1080/02680513.2022.2072721			44958	a=openeducation	m=document review AND m=interview	d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=BEN AND geo=CMR AND geo=CIV and GEO=ETH AND geo=GHA AND geo=MLI AND geo=MOZ and geo=NGA AND geo=ZAF AND geo=ZMB		a=openeducation	m=document review	d=none	t=researcher	geo=AF							
3641	Scopus	The Viewpoints of Alborz University of Medical Sciences’ Faculty Members on Open Peer Review of Journal Articles	Faculty Members; Open Peer Review; Peer Review; Scientific Articles; Scientific Journals; Traditional Peer Review	Background and Aim: The open peer review process, which is one of the peer-reviewed methods in journals, has been accepted in scientific forums. The aim of this study was to investigate the points of view of university faculty members about the open peer review process of journal articles. Materials and Methods: The study used a descriptive survey. The sample size was calculated using the Cochran’s formula of 150 people out of a total of 246 faculty members of Alborz University of Medical Sciences. The research tool was a questionnaire designed based on the existing literature. Data were analyzed by SPSS software using descriptive statistics and paired t-test. Results: The results showed that the participants’ views on “approaches and processes of open peer review” with 3.48 mean score and “benefits of open peer review” with mean score of 3.70 were relatively desirable. Among the open peer review styles, participants preferred the “open reporting” and “data peer review” styles, respectively. Participants’ views on the “advantages and disadvantages of open peer review” also indicated that participants agreed with most of the components presented in this area. There was also a statistically significant difference between the mean score of participants’ views on the traditional peer review process and open peer review (P<0.05). Conclusion: Open peer review is relatively accepted among the faculty members of Alborz University of Medical Sciences. As the acceptance of this type of peer review increases among the scientific community, paying attention to the attitudes and views related to the open peer review process can improve the quality of articles and research published in scientific journals. © 2022 the Authors.

3644	WoS	Threat of policy alienation: Exploring the implementation of Open Science policy in research practice	Open Science; policy alienation; research policy; science policy; open access; principal-agent theory	Many European countries have introduced Open Science (OS) policies to improve the quality and efficiency of science and to increase economic and societal growth. Researchers' perceptions and experiences of OS policies remain relatively under-investigated. This explorative study applies the policy alienation perspective to understand researchers' perceptions of OS policy implementation. Analysis of survey responses indicates that researchers have difficulties in coping with OS policy and that they feel policy alienation from OS policy. Hence, researchers may be less willing to try to support OS policy implementation despite the fact that OS policies are motivated by the desire to enhance the excellence and quality of research. The findings address how the incentive problems lie not only in the research evaluation and academic credit systems but also in the policy-practice divide. These problems need to be solved in terms of participation in policymaking and in the knowledge production of 'openness' itself.	10.1093/scipol/scaa044	Lilja, Erika				J		SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY	English	Article				[Lilja, Erika] Tampere Univ, Fac Management & Business, Higher Educ Grp, Tampere, Finland; [Lilja, Erika] Univ Turku, INVEST Res Flagship Ctr, FI-20014 Turku, Finland		69.0	1.0	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0302-3427		2020.0	47.0	6.0	803.0	817.0	10.1093/scipol/scaa044	WOS:000649372700005		44958	a=openpolicies AND a=openaccess AND a=opendata AND a=openmethod AND a=openevaluation	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=FIN		a=openpolicies	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=EU							
3656	WoS	Towards Open Science for the Qualitative Researcher: From a Positivist to an Open Interpretation	open science; data handling; pseudonymisation; epistemological questioning	This reflection by a qualitative researcher stems from a concrete experience with data handling in a funded research project. The researcher followed Open Research Data guidelines and found optimal solutions to pseudonymise data, but this later evolved into a deep epistemological questioning on praxis. During the first phase of the project, a tailor-made software was developed with help from librarians and an IT professional to automate the pseudonymisation of the 150 data chunks generated by 16 students, 3 tutors and 3 decision makers. In the second phase of the project, this experience sparked questions about the meaning of such data handling and interpretations of Open Science, which led the researcher to suggest a framework for the professional development of qualitative researchers in their understanding of Open Science. The article raises awareness of normative frameworks in institutional data handling practices and calls for active contributions to defining qualitative research in an Open Science perspective, particularly taking as a reference the recent draft recommendation by UNESCO (2020)	10.1177/16094069211034641	Class, Barbara; de Bruyne, Miguel; Wuillemin, Claire; Donze, Dimitri; Claivaz, Jean-Blaise				J		INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS	English	Article				[Class, Barbara] Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, TECFA Educ Technol Unit, 40 Blvd Pont Arve, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [de Bruyne, Miguel] Univ Geneva, CUI Comp Sci Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wuillemin, Claire; Donze, Dimitri; Claivaz, Jean-Blaise] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland		77.0	0.0	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1609-4069		2021.0	20.0				10.1177/16094069211034641	WOS:000703913600001		44958	a=opendata AND a=opensoftware	m=other	d=none	t=researcher AND t=librarian AND t=policy AND t=unisupportstaff AND t=other	geo=AF AND geo=EU		a=opendata	m=other	d=none	t=researcher	geo=CHE

This article gives an introduction to open research data policies and measures in China, and reports on the status of constructing necessary infrastructure, specifically open data repositories. We compare open data repositories in China and Western countries in terms of scale, subject distribution, data policies, service and content operations. In addition, this article summarizes methods and motivations for data sharing among researchers in China. Finally, the paper discusses the characteristics, potential problems and challenges of China's open research data practices. We conclude with some suggestions for the future development of open research data in China from data policy, infrastructure construction, compliance with international standards and norms, credibility and influence improvement, incentives for data sharing and encouraging data sharing research practices.	10.1002/leap.1439	Li, CZ; Zhou, YC; Zheng, XH; Zhang, ZY; Jiang, LL; Li, ZW; Wang, PY; Li, JH; Xu, SY; Wang, ZJ																					2022.0					10.1002/leap.1439			44958	a=opendata AND a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=med AND d=agric AND d=socscie AND d=hum	t=none	geo=CHN		a=opendata	m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=CHN

Open science increases trust in science for the public and academics	open science; questionable research practices; trust; epistemic trust	Researchers often focus on the benefits of adopting open science, yet questions remain whether the general public, as well as academics, value and trust studies consistent with open science compared to studies without open science. In three preregistered experiments (total N = 2,691), we find that the general public perceived open science research and researchers as more credible and trustworthy than non-open science counterparts (Studies 1 and 2). We also explored if open science practices compensated for negative perceptions of privately-funded research versus publicly-funded research (Study 2), although the evidence did not support this hypothesis. Finally, Study 3 examined how communication scholars perceive researchers and their work as a function of open science adoption, along with publication outlet (e.g., high-prestige vs. low-prestige journals). We observed open science research was perceived more favorably than non-open science research by academics. We discuss implications for the open science movement and public trust in science.	10.1093/joc/jqac017	Song, H; Markowitz, DM; Taylor, SH																					2022.0					10.1093/joc/jqac017			44958	a=openparticipation AND a=openscience	m=survey	d=none AND d=socscie	t=researcher AND t=other	geo=all	The article describes multiple studies	a=openscience	m=other	d=socscie	t=other	geo=all							
3668	Scopus	UiT-Researchers' Attitudes and Practices Towards Open Access Publication: Lessons Learnt for Improving SelfArchiving in Institutional Repository		Objective. Using The Munin Repository at UiT The Arctic University of Norway as a case study, a survey was conducted among the UiT researchers to examine their attitudes and practices towards the repository and towards open access (OA) publications. Methods. The survey questionnaire was sent to all employees at UiT between August and October 2016, but only academic staff in research positions, including PhD students, were selected for the analysis. 200 researchers responded to the survey. Results. The study found that researchers are supportive of the principle of OA but are less keen on contributing to their institutional repositories for a range of reasons. These include the process being quite a hassle, academics' uncertainty over certain legal, copyright and peer review issues, prestige issues, and uncertainty over the appropriate version to deposit or self-archive. Contribution. The statistical results can be used by readers as benchmarks to compare with their own institution's figures. Conclusively, the study found that more than 90% of the researchers agreed with the OA principles, but still 54% of UiT researchers did not archive their research documents in The Munin Repository. © 2021 The authors.

3671	WoS	Understanding Sexual Assault Survivors' Perspectives on Archiving Qualitative Data: Implications for Feminist Approaches to Open Science	open science; qualitative interviews; data sharing; archiving; sexual assault	The open science movement has framed data sharing as necessary and achievable best practices for high-quality science. Feminist psychologists have complicated that narrative by questioning the purpose of data sharing across different paradigms, methodologies, and research populations. In these debates, the academic community has centered the needs and voices of researchers, and participants' perspectives are largely missing from this literature. In this study, we sought to understand how research participants feel about sharing qualitative data on a sensitive subject-sexual victimization. As part of a participatory action research project, we conducted qualitative interviews with sexual assault survivors about their post-assault help-seeking experiences. The federal funding agency that supported this project requires researchers to archive de-identified data in a national data repository (the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data [NACJD]). All participants consented to archiving data, and the vast majority expressed positive views about data sharing because they wanted to help other survivors. Participants emphasized that our participatory action research approach and our stated goal of helping survivors were important considerations in their decisions regarding data sharing.

Quantitative method followed by survey research design was used to conduct this study. Self-administered questionnaire validated by field experts was used to gather the data from the participants. The population of this study was postgraduate LIS research scholars from Punjab, who were enrolled in M. Phil. (2015-2017) and Ph. D. (20152018) programs. The survey was administrated personally. The data was gathered from 78 research scholars of Library and Information Science from the five LIS schools in Punjab. The data were analyzed through Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Software. This study found that LIS participants preferred both resources like, subscribed and open access resources. The use of subscribed resources by Library and Information Science research scholars was preferred to open access resources for finding the articles and accessible anywhere of the world. There is a tendency among the researchers that due to lack of awareness, limited knowledge about existing research facilities, they do not fully utilize open access resources for their research and the database developed by the institution(s). A bunch of scholars does not aware of open access resources and due to this their utilization of this facility is quite low. Most of the libraries and the organization(s) do not have the facility and resources to have access to “subscribed electronic resources” due to heavy cost. Present study concludes that the LIS scholars prefer to use open access resources because of free availability on internet as compared to subscribed resources. Subscribed resources have a limited access only within the campus. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.		Hussain, L.N.; Shahzad, K.; Awan, S.I.

3680	WoS	Usage, content and citation in open access publication: any interaction effects?	Open access publications; Mediation analysis; Social media; Altmetrics	This study aims to validate an empirical model, at document level, that explains the interaction among content, usage, and citation within open access publications. The PLoS site was the information source for this study. Using an R API (Application Programming Interface) for PLoS ONE, 776,465 records were downloaded on August 24, 2018. Those records (from 2006 to 2018) were organized according to the PLoS' thematic areas. The empirical framework was validated using mediation analysis. For computing the parameters' significance, bootstrapping with 500 replications for the general model and each thematic area was used. When usage was included as the mediating variable within the model, the total effects of cognitive and social variables got better predictive capability, as expressed by the explained variance of citation (R-2 = 0.282) and usage (R-2 = 0.333). The same trend was observed for the indirect effects after carrying out the mediation analysis by categories. Promotion campaigns of scientific publication should reinforce the widespread adoption of easy-to-use social media because, besides the velocity and variety of diffusion channels, the extended use guarantees that journal's papers will reach increasing audiences. This is one of the first studies that analyze the interaction effects of variables at the article-level within open access publications.	10.1007/s11192-021-04178-5	Vilchez-Roman, Carlos; Vara-Horna, Aristides				J		SCIENTOMETRICS	English	Article				[Vilchez-Roman, Carlos] Ctr Catolica Grad Business Sch CCGBS, Lima, Peru; [Vara-Horna, Aristides] Univ San Martin Porres USMP, Lima, Peru		49.0	0.0	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0138-9130		2021.0	126.0	12.0	9457.0	9476.0	10.1007/s11192-021-04178-5	WOS:000710334600006		44958	a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=med AND d=agric AND d=socscie	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=a							
3681	WoS	Use Analysis of Various LIS Open Access Resources in Pandemic Situation in Odisha State. A Survey Include LIS User's Opinion	Open access resources; LIS in Odisha; LIS repositories; LIS archive	This study looks at how students and researchers in Library and Information Science in the Indian state of Odisha use Open Access Resources (OARs) and how much they know about them. We used an online questionnaire to get the information we needed, and then we used SPSS V.22 and MS Excel to analyse the information. In this study, a number of Open Access resources, Open Educational Resources (OERs), and Open Course Wares (OCWs) were described, and the level of users' awareness of these resources was also looked at. What are the main factors that encourage students and researchers in Odisha to use open access resources as much as possible? These factors were also brought up in the study. Pearson's correlation was used to find out if there was a link between knowing about open access resources and using them. What are the main ways that people in Odisha found out about open access resources? This study also looked at the things that make people less likely to use open access resources, such as OERs and OCWs. It also looked at how satisfied users are with these OERs and OCWs.

3682	WoS	Use of Open Access Channels for Scholarly Publishing in Kenyan Universities	Open access channels; Open access scholarly publishing; Universities in Kenya	The study investigated the awareness and use of open access (OA) channels for scholarly publishing by researchers at selected universities in Kenya. A sample of 341 faculty members, from three public universities, was selected for the study. A questionnaire was used as the main data collection instrument. The findings revealed that there is a considerably high level of awareness among the researchers; librarians were the main channel with regard to creating awareness; the OA channels that are more frequently used by researchers are OA journals, OA institutional repositories and OA e-books; the researchers mostly published/disseminated theses and dissertations, conference proceedings and workshop/seminar presentations through OA channels; and searching and accessing research articles, developing research proposals and formulating research problems were among the main reasons why researchers used open access channels. There are several reasons why researchers sometimes do not use OA channels for research. The study makes several recommendations for the adoption and effective use of OA channels in the selected universities and beyond.	10.1007/s12109-021-09795-9	Waithaka, Mercy W.; Onyancha, Omwoyo Bosire				J		PUBLISHING RESEARCH QUARTERLY	English	Article				[Waithaka, Mercy W.] Univ Nairobi, The Library, Nairobi, Kenya; [Waithaka, Mercy W.; Onyancha, Omwoyo Bosire] Univ South Africa Unisa, Dept Informat Sci, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa		52.0	2.0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES	1053-8801		2021.0	37.0	2.0	293.0	306.0	10.1007/s12109-021-09795-9	WOS:000628082300001		44958	a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=KEN		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=KEN							
3683	Scopus	Use Of open Access Journals By Librarians In Ghana		Introduction: This study examined the use of open access journals by librarians in Ghana. The objectives were to establish the familiarity, attitude and benefits of open access journals among librarians in Ghana. Method: This study uses a survey research design. A web-based questionnaire was used to seek information on respondents' demographics, awareness, use, attitudes and benefits of open access journals. Analysis: Descriptive statistics was used to analyze survey results. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for the analysis of data collected from 103 librarians who are members of the Ghana Library Association. Results: All the respondents were aware of open access journals and to a greater extent that they showed positive attitude towards open access journals. Many of them however, are not fully committed to publishing their articles in open access journals. It is recommended that, librarians should be willing to publish more of their research works in open access journals in order for them to be ambassadors and advocate for open access. Conclusion: Knowledge of open access journals and related content among librarians is crucial not only in disseminating research quality but also in weeding out poor content. © 2021.

Open access repositories were selected from OpenDOAR in the year 2021. Later, websites of all repositories were manually checked to identify the existence of Web 2.0 tools. The results revealed that Japan has established the maximum number of open access digital repositories in Asia, followed by Indonesia, Turkey, India, and China. The study shows that out of the total 101 social science institutional repositories found in these top five Asian countries, only 92 repositories were operational, and the rest weren't accessible. From the operational repositories, 31.60 per cent (30) were Web 2.0 enabled, and 69.40 per cent (62) hadn't incorporated Web 2.0 in their repositories. The highest number of Web 2.0 enabled repositories was found in Turkey, followed by Indonesia and China. Japan has the highest number of OA repositories but lags behind Turkey, Indonesia, and China in Web 2.0 enabled repositories. The least number of Web 2.0 enabled repositories were found in India among these countries. RSS feeds and Atom were the most used Web 2.0 tools in these institutional repositories.	10.14429/djlit.42.3.17473	Khan, AM; Loan, FA; Andrabi, SAA																					2022.0					10.14429/djlit.42.3.17473			44958	a=openaccess AND a=opentools	m=other	d=socscie	t=none	geo=AS		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=university	geo=AS							
3709	WoS	What do Incoming University Students Believe About Open Science Practices in Psychology?	open science; psychology; teaching; reproducibility; replication	Background Understanding students' naive conceptions about the norms that guide scientific best practice is important so that teachers can adapt to students' existing understandings. Objective We examined what incoming undergraduate students of psychology believe about reproducibility and open science practices. Method We conducted an online survey with participants who were about to start their first course in psychology at a university (N = 239). Results When asked to indicate how a researcher should conduct her study, most students endorsed several open science practices. When asked to estimate the proportion of published psychological studies that follow various open science practices, participants' estimates averaged near 50%. Only 18% of participants reported that they had heard the term replication crisis. Conclusion Despite media attention about the replication crisis, few incoming psychology students in our sample were familiar with the term. The students were nevertheless in favour of most open science practices, although they overestimated the prevalence of some of these practices in psychology. Teaching Implications Teachers of incoming psychology students should not assume pre-existing knowledge about open science or replicability.	10.1177/00986283221100276	Beaudry, JL; Williams, MN; Philipp, MC; Kothe, EJ																					2022.0					10.1177/00986283221100276			44958	a=openmethod AND a=openaccess AND a=opendata	m=survey	d=socscie	t=other	geo=AUS AND geo=GBR AND geo=USA AND geo=NZL		a=openscience	m=survey	d=socscie	t=other	geo=AUS; geo=USA; geo=GBR; geo=NZL

But it also presents practical, theoretical, and ethical considerations for qualitative researchers in particular. Discussion about open data in qualitative social psychology predates the replication crisis. However, the nuances of this ongoing discussion have not been translated into current journal guidelines on open data. In this article, we summarize ongoing debates about open data from qualitative perspectives, and through a content analysis of 261 journals we establish the state of current journal policies for open data in the domain of social psychology. We critically discuss how current common expectations for open data may not be adequate for establishing qualitative rigour, can introduce ethical challenges, and may place those who wish to use qualitative approaches at a disadvantage in peer review and publication processes. We advise that future open data guidelines should aim to reflect the nuance of arguments surrounding data sharing in qualitative research, and move away from a universal one-size-fits-all approach to data sharing. This article outlines the past, present, and the potential future of open data guidelines in social-psychological journals. We conclude by offering recommendations for how journals might more inclusively consider the use of open data in qualitative methods, whilst recognizing and allowing space for the diverse perspectives, needs, and contexts of all forms of social-psychological research.	10.1111/bjso.12576	Prosser, AMB; Hamshaw, RJT; Meyer, J; Bagnall, R; Blackwood, L; Huysamen, M; Jordan, A; Vasileiou, K; Walter, Z																					2022.0					10.1111/bjso.12576			44958	a=opendata AND a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=socscie	t=none	geo=all		a=opendata	m=document review	d=socscie	t=publisher	geo=all							
3714	WoS	Who are the users of national open access journals? The case of the Finnish Journal.fi platform	Scholarly publishing; Open access; Altmetrics	In this paper we study the diversity of users of open access articles on the Finnish Journal.fi platform. This platform hosts around hundred open access journals from Finland publishing in different fields and mainly Finnish and English languages. The study is based on an online survey, conducted on 48 journals during Spring 2020, in which visitors were asked to indicate their background and allow their location and download behaviour be tracked. Among 668 survey participants, the two largest groups were students (40%) and researchers (36%), followed by private citizens (8%), other experts (7%) and teachers (5%). Other identified user categories include journalists, civil servants, entrepreneurs and politicians. While new publications attract a considerable share of the views, there is still a relatively large interest, especially among students, in older materials. Our findings indicate that Finnish language publications are particularly important for reaching students, citizens, experts and politicians. Thus, open access to publications in national languages is vital for the local relevance and outreach of research.	10.1002/leap.1405	Polonen, Janne; Syrjamaki, Sami; Nygard, Antti-Jussi; Hammarfelt, Bjorn				J		LEARNED PUBLISHING	English	Article				[Polonen, Janne; Syrjamaki, Sami; Nygard, Antti-Jussi] Federat Finnish Learned Soc, Snellmaninkatu 13, Helsinki 00170, Finland; [Hammarfelt, Bjorn] Univ Boras, Swedish Sch Lib & Informat Sci, Allegatan 1, S-50332 Boras, Sweden		29.0	0.0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0953-1513		2022.0	34.0	4.0	585.0	592.0	10.1002/leap.1405	WOS:000653496000001		44958	a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher AND t=policy AND t=business AND t=other	geo=FIN		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher; t=other	geo=FIN							
3717	WoS	Why Open Access: Economics and Business Researchers' Perspectives	scholarly journal publishing; subscription model; open access model; Gold Route; economics and business; author's perspective	Public research policies have been promoting open-access publication in recent years as an adequate model for the dissemination of scientific knowledge. However, depending on the disciplines, its use is very diverse. This study explores the determinants of open-access publication among academic researchers of economics and business, as well as their assessment of different economic measures focused on publication stimulus. To do so, a survey of Spanish business and economics researchers was conducted. They reported an average of 19% of their publications in open-access journals, hybrids or fully Gold Route open access. Almost 80% of the researchers foresee a future increase in the volume of open-access publications. When determining where to publish their research results, the main criterion for the selection of a scientific journal is the impact factor. Regarding open access, the most valued aspect is the visibility and dissemination it provides. Although the cost of publication is not the most relevant criterion in the choice of a journal, three out of four researchers consider that a reduction in fees and an increase in funding are measures that would boost the open-access model.	10.3390/publications9030037	Lopez-Vergara, Carmen; Flores Asenjo, Pilar; Rosa-Garcia, Alfonso				J		PUBLICATIONS	English	Article				[Lopez-Vergara, Carmen; Flores Asenjo, Pilar] Univ Catolica San Antonio Murcia, Dept Ciencias Sociales Jurid & Empresa, Av Los Jeronimos 135, Murcia 30107, Spain; [Rosa-Garcia, Alfonso] Univ Murcia, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus Espinardo,Edificio 2, Murcia 30100, Spain		40.0	0.0	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND			2021.0	9.0	3.0			10.3390/publications9030037	WOS:000700159600001		44958	a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=survey	d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=ESP		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=socscie	t=researcher	geo=ESP							
3719	Snowball	Wirkungen von Open Access. Literaturstudie über empirische Arbeiten 2010-2021		Open Access - the free access to scientific publications - intuitively offers many advantages. At the same time, some scientists, members of university administration, publishers, and policymakers continue to have reservations against open access. In the last decade, numerous empirical studies on the effects of open access were conducted. This report provides an overview of the state of research from 2010 to 2021. The empirical findings presented help determine the advantages and disadvantages of open access and serve as a knowledge base for scholars, publishers, academic institutions, and policy makers. An overview of the state of knowledge informs decisions on open access and publishing strategies. In addition, this report identifies aspects of open-access effects that are potentially highly relevant but have not yet been adequately studied. Overall, various advantages of open access can be considered empirically confirmed at the current state of research. These advantages include improved knowledge transfer, increased speed of the publication process, and increased usage by a more diverse readership, both in terms of profession and location. In addition, some presumed negative effects - such as lower quality of publications and disadvantages in the sale of print editions - can be considered empirically refuted. The empirical results on effects of open-access publishing therefore support the goal of a far-reaching transformation to open access, to which the German science organisations, among others, have committed themselves.	10.34657/7666	Hopf, D.; Dellmann, S.; Hauschke, C.; Tullney, M.																					2022.0					10.34657/7666			44960	a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3036	Scopus	Built to last! Embedding open science principles and practice into European universities		The purpose of this article is to examine the cultural change needed by universities, as identified by LERU in its report Open Science and its role in universities: a roadmap for cultural change.1 It begins by illustrating the nature of that cultural change. Linked to that transformation is a necessary management change to the way in which organizations perform research. Competition is not the only, or necessarily the best, way to conduct this transformation. Open science brings to the fore the values of collaboration and sharing. Building on a number of Focus on Open Science Workshops held over five years across Europe, the article identifies best practice in changing current research practices, which will then contribute to the culture change necessary to deliver open science. Four case studies, delivered at Focus on Open Science Workshops or other conferences in Europe, illustrate the advances that are being made: the findings of a Workshop on Collaboration and Competition at the OAI 11 meeting in Geneva in June 2019; alternative publishing platforms, exemplified by UCL Press; open data, FAIR data and reproducibility; and a Citizen Science Workshop held at the LIBER Conference in Dublin in June 2019. © 2020 Tiberius Ignat and Paul Ayris.	10.1629/UKSG.501	Ignat, T.; Ayris, P.

3096	WoS	Decentralizing science: Towards an interoperable open peer review ecosystem using blockchain	Blockchain; Decentralized systems; Distributed systems; Open access; Open peer review; Peer review	Scientific publication and its Peer Review system strongly rely on a few major industry players controlling most journals (e.g. Elsevier), databases (e.g. Scopus) and metrics (e.g. JCR Impact Factor), while keeping most articles behind paywalls. Critics to such system include concerns about fairness, quality, performance, cost, unpaid labor, transparency, and accuracy of the evaluation process. The Open Access movement has tried to provide free access to the published research articles, but most of the aforementioned issues remain. In such context, decentralized technologies such as blockchain offer an opportunity to experiment with new models for scientific production and dissemination relying on a decentralized infrastructure, aiming to tackle multiple of the current system shortcomings. This paper makes a proposal for an interoperable decentralized system for an open peer review ecosystem, relying on emerging distributed technologies such as blockchain and IPFS. Such system, named Decentralized Science(DecSci), aims to enable a decentralized reviewer reputation system, which relies on an Open Access by-design infrastructure, together with transparent governance processes. Two prototypes have been implemented: a proof-of-concept prototype to validate DecSci's technological feasibility, and a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) prototype co-designed with journal editors. In addition, three evaluations have been carried out: an exploratory survey to assess interest on the issues tackled; two sets of interviews to confirm both the main problems for editors and to validate the MVP prototype; and a cost analysis of the main operations, both execution cost and actual price. Additionally, the paper discusses the multiple interoperability challenges such proposal faces, including an architecture to tackle them. This work finishes with a review of some of the open challenges that this ambitious proposal may face.	10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102724	Tenorio-Fornes, Ambar; Perez Tirador, Elena; Sanchez-Ruiz, Antonio A.; Hassan, Samer				J		INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT	English	Article				[Tenorio-Fornes, Ambar; Perez Tirador, Elena] Decentralized Acad Ltd, Decentralized Sci, Madrid, Spain; [Tenorio-Fornes, Ambar; Hassan, Samer] Univ Complutense Madrid, Knowledge Technol Inst, GRASIA, Madrid, Spain; [Hassan, Samer] Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sanchez-Ruiz, Antonio A.] Univ Complutense Madrid, GAIA, Madrid, Spain		87.0	0.0	ELSEVIER SCI LTD	OXFORD	THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND	0306-4573		2021.0	58.0	6.0			10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102724	WOS:000697699500005		44958	a=openmethod AND a=openevaluation AND a=opentools	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher AND t=publishers AND t=business	geo=all	survey & interview investigating the effectiveness = empirical?	a=openevaluation	m=survey; m=interview	d=natscie	t=none	geo=all

3281	WoS	Korea's national approach to Open Science: Present and possible future	Digital infrastructure; legal instruments; Open Science; South Korea; SWOT; TOWS matrix	Open Science (OS) - an emerging global trend driven by advances in digital technologies and government's commitment to greater transparency and value for money of publicly funded research - is at its early stages, even in countries with high R&D expenditures, such as South Korea. This study provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of Korea's national OS approach, with a focus on exploring the current OS regulatory and technological environments it operates under, and uncovering its SWOT - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. It concludes that internal weaknesses, such as insufficient political will to promote OS, dominate other SWOT characteristics of Korea's national OS approach. Thus, the highest priority should be given to strategies attempting to minimise both internal weaknesses and external threats, such as reinforcing domestic Open Access publishing ecosystem to mitigate Korean researchers' dependency on large international commercial publishers.	10.1177/01655515221107336	Shmagun, H; Shim, J; Choi, KN; Shin, SK; Kim, J; Oppenheim, C																					2022.0					10.1177/01655515221107336			44958	a=openpolicies AND a=openscience	m=interview AND m=documentreview	d=none	t=policy	geo=KOR	This paper meets the standards of a case study much better.

3429	WoS	OPEN SCIENCE AND THE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMAGUEY IN ACADEMIC SOCIAL NETWORKS	open science; scientific production; almetrics; ResearchGate; Google scholar; academic social networks	Objective. Analyze the presence of the scientific community of the University of Camaguey and its scientific production in ResearchGate and Google Scholar, tools of high social use, have also been extended to the academic context and have an essential role in the development of open science. Design/Methodology/Approach. The research is developed from the empirical analysis of the behavior of all the activity that is generate in ResearchGate and Google Scholar through the metric indicators present in these digital spaces. Results/Discusion. The results obtained show the existence of the said institution's researchers and their scientific and academic work in ResearchGate and Google Scholar, as well as the use of their benefits for the dissemination of scientific results. In addition, little presence of the scientific community of the institution was observe in both platforms. Conclusions. Positioning the scientific production of universities in scientific collaboration platforms such as academic social networks, this is a practice of vital importance to take new steps in the development of open science for the visibility of science, such as on the web. Despite this, the presence of the University of Camaguey in ResearchGate and Google Scholar is discreet and does not correspond to the scientific-investigative capacity of the academic institution.

3432	WoS	Open science at the science-policy interface: bringing in the evidence?	Research uptake; Evidence-policy gap; Policy theory; Open science	Part of the current enthusiasm about open science stems from its promises to reform scientific practice in service of the common good, to ensure that scientific outputs will be found and reused more easily, and to enhance scientific impact on policy and society. With this article, we question this optimism by analysing the potential for open science practices to enhance research uptake at the science-policy interface. Science advice is critical to help policy-makers make informed decisions. Likewise, some interpretations of open science hold that making research processes and outputs more transparent and accessible will also enhance the uptake of results by policy and society at large. However, we argue that this hope is based on an unjustifiably simplistic understanding of the science-policy interface that leaves key terms (impact, uptake) undefined. We show that this understanding-based upon linear models of research uptake-likewise grounds the influential evidence-policy gap diagnosis which holds that to improve research uptake, communication and interaction between researchers and policy-makers need to be improved. The overall normative stance of both discussions has sidelined empirical description of the science-policy interface, ignoring questions about the underlying differences between the policy domain and academia. Importantly, both open science and literature on closing the evidence-policy gap recommend improving communication (in terms of either the content or the means) as a viable strategy. To correct some of these views, we combine insights from policy theory with a narrative review of the literature on the evidence-policy gap in the health domain and find that removing barriers to access by itself will not be enough to foster research uptake.	10.1186/s12961-022-00867-6	Reichmann, S; Wieser, B																					2022.0					10.1186/s12961-022-00867-6			44958	a=openpolicy AND a=openscience	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all	Literature Review; no empirical study						"""narrative review"" (as well as systematic review) is not empirical"						
3442	Scopus	Open Science in Seismology: The Role of Citizen Science in the Transition from Seismic Observatory to Science Museum	citizen science; open science; science communication; science museum; seismology	Catastrophic events, including worldwide pandemics and natural disasters, may lead to ambivalent attitudes toward science among the public. On the one hand, there may be pessimistic feelings toward the limitations of scientific knowledge and technology. On the other hand, there may be optimistic prospects for science-based solutions to the problems caused by these catastrophes. Science communication plays an integral part in shaping societal attitudes toward science. The aim of this research was to build more fruitful relationships between science and society by improving science communication in the field of seismology. Based on the concept of open science, we conducted action research at a seismic observatory as it transitioned from a science facility to a science museum. The museum adopted a citizen-science approach to communicating the science of seismology. In this approach, citizens not only learned about seismology from scientists, but they worked collaboratively with scientists to do science. The results of our research showed that citizen science can play a critical role in making science more accessible and communicating the science of seismology to society. © 2022 The authors.	10.5595/001c.35742	Yamori K., Iio Y., Shiroshita H.																					2022.0					10.5595/001c.35742			44958	a=openparticipation	m=other	d=natscie	t=researchers AND t=unisupportstaff AND t=policy AND t=other	geo=JPN		a=openparticipation	m=other	d=natscie	t=other	geo=JPN							
3444	WoS	Open Science Knowledge Production: Addressing Epistemological Challenges and Ethical Implications	open science; epistemology; data; falsification; fabrication; model	Open Science (OS) is envisioned to have a wide range of benefits including being more transparent, shared, accessible, and collaboratively developed than traditional science. Despite great enthusiasm, there are also several challenges with OS. In order to ensure that OS obtains its benefits, these challenges need to be addressed. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to provide an overview of one type of challenge, i.e., epistemological challenges with OS knowledge production, and their ethical implications. Based on a literature review, it (a) reveals factors undermining the envisioned benefits of OS, (b) identifies negative effects on knowledge production, and (c) exposes epistemological challenges with the various phases of the OS process. The main epistemic challenges are related to governance, framing, looping effects, proper data procurement, validation, replication, bias, and polarization. The ethical implications are injustice, reduced benefit (efficiency), increased harm (as a consequence of poor-quality science), deception and manipulation (reduced autonomy), and lack of trustworthiness. Accordingly, to obtain the envisioned benefits of OS, we need to address these epistemological challenges and their ethical implications.	10.3390/publications10030024	Hofmann, B																					2022.0					10.3390/publications10030024			44958						Literature Review; no empirical study						literature review is not empirical						
3469	Scopus	Opportunities for open access: Insights from the Wiley Practitioner Survey		There is less awareness of open-access publishing amongst practitioners than amongst their academic colleagues. The requirement for certification is a significant driver of professional society membership, particularly for those in clinical and veterinary medicine. Flipping a society journal from a subscription model to fully open access may drive down satisfaction. Professional society members state a desire for increased collaboration with academics and feel that societies have a role to play in this. Satisfaction levels with society membership are generally low amongst early career members (ECMs), but there are some clear opportunities for targeted services to improve this. Awareness of open access is reasonably high, and there are calls for greater transparency and improved data sharing, particularly from ECMs and engineers. © 2020 The Authors.

3484	Scopus	Political economy of Plan S: a post-foundational perspective on Open Access		Plan S, promoted by cOAlition S, is a significant attempt to hegemonize a specific form of Open Access (OA) as the future of academic publishing on a global level. It mandates that the results from Coalition-funded research must be published in fora compliant with its criteria. This article questions the Plan’s supposed radicalness from a political economy perspective with the help of post-foundational discourse theory. Specific attention will be paid to its implications for property rights as the contingent foundation of knowledge production. The Plan and OA will be examined within the context of globally unequal structures of scientific knowledge production and attempts to transform them into a more equal system. The analyzed data consist of the archive from the following sequence: (i) the publication of draft guidance on the implementation of the Plan, released by the Coalition in November 2018, (ii) a collection of feedback statements on the draft by the Coalition from November 2018 to February 2019, and (iii) release of the updated guidance adopted and published by the Coalition in May 2019. The primary object of analysis is the antagonism articulated towards the Plan within what is here termed the conservative-propertarian discursive formation. © 2021 The Author(s).

3652	Scopus	Towards a credibility revolution in bilingualism research: Open data and materials as stepping stones to more reproducible and replicable research		The extent to which findings in bilingualism research are contingent on specific analytic choices, experimental designs, or operationalisations, is currently unknown. Poor availability of data, analysis code, and materials has hindered the development of cumulative lines of research. In this review, we survey current practices and advocate a credibility revolution in bilingualism research through the adoption of minimum standards of transparency. Full disclosure of data and code is necessary not only to assess the reproducibility of original findings, but also to test the robustness of these findings to different analytic specifications. Similarly, full provision of experimental materials and protocols underpins assessment of both the replicability of original findings, as well as their generalisability to different contexts and samples. We illustrate the review with examples where good practice has advanced the agenda in bilingualism research and highlight resources to help researchers get started. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

3669	Scopus	Uncovering open access criticisms by visualizing texts with voyant tools [Descubriendo críticas al acceso abierto mediante la visualización de textos con voyant tools]		"Voyant Tools is an open-source web environment designed to facilitate the hermeneutical cycle by navigating between different levels of reading, analysis, and interactive visualization of texts (scientific articles, web pages, Twitter messages, literary works). The objective of this article is to exemplify how we can use this tool for the exploration and analysis of scientific texts, discovering themes and associations between documents. 33 scientific documents that question and problematize the open access and open science movements are used as a corpus for analysis. Through different analytical and visualization tools, emerge terms (open source, APC, impact factor, prestige, exclusion, colonialism, coloniality) that as traces of ""breadcrumbs"" serve to make new explorations and visualizations that allow to identify authors, documents and problems related to open access and open science. It is concluded that Voyant Tools is a versatile and intuitive tool with various potentialities for the analysis and discovery of information in texts. Regarding the topic explored, criticisms and problematizations related to the emphasis on the market and capitalist acceleration behind open access and open science policies and initiatives are identified, with the rise of the commercial open access journals’ business model based on article processing charge (APC) and the appearance of new colonialism and epistemicide when open access, commodification of knowledge and distorted use of the impact factor are combined. © 2021, Centro Nacional de Informacion de Ciencias Medicas.

2936	Scopus	“I can Just Get all the Bits That I Need”: Practitioners’ Use of Open-Access Sport Science Podcasts		The aim of the current investigation was to explore practitioners’ attitudes toward and reasons for listening to open-access podcasts. It is well accepted within the literature that sport and exercise practitioners, such as coaches and sport scientists, perceive several barriers to access of scientific and academic research. Open-access podcasts may provide an alternative platform for developing esoteric knowledge. Nine sport and exercise practitioners (including gym owners, nutritionists, and sport coaches) participated in the investigation. A single-semi structured interview was conducted, and data were analyzed using a thematic network analysis approach. Three themes were constructed from the data—flexibility of podcast listening, convenience of podcast listening, practitioners’ need for authentic and novel information. © Copyright © 2021 Shaw and McNamara.	10.3389/feduc.2021.666865	Shaw, M.P.; McNamara, S.W.T.

2938	Scopus	A cohort study of how faculty in LIS schools perceive and engage with open-access publishing	Faculty authors; Journal publication; journals; Library and information science; Library and information studies; North American; Open access; Open access journals; Scholarly communication; Surveys	This article presents results from a survey of faculty in North American Library and Information Studies (LIS) schools about their attitudes towards and experience with open-access publishing. As a follow-up to a similar survey conducted in 2013, the article also outlines the differences in beliefs about and engagement with open access that have occurred between 2013 and 2018. Although faculty in LIS schools are proponents of free access to research, journal publication choices remain informed by traditional considerations such as prestige and impact factor. Engagement with open access has increased significantly, while perceptions of open access have remained relatively stable between 2013 and 2018. Nonetheless, those faculty who have published in an open-access journal or are more knowledgeable about open access tend to be more convinced about the quality of open-access publications and less apprehensive about open-access publishing than those who have no publishing experience with open-access journals or who are less knowledgeable about various open-access modalities. Willingness to comply with gold open-access mandates has increased significantly since 2013. © The Author(s) 2019.	10.1177/0165551519865481	Peekhaus, W.

1111	WoS	A Study of Distribution and Growth of Open Access Research Journals Across the World	Research journals; Open access journals; DOAJ; Journal growth; Predatory journals; World; Continents	The study aims to assess the growth of Open Access (OA) research journals indexed in Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) during the last two decades viz., for the period 2002 through 2021 across the world. More so the growth has also been assessed at the continental and subject level. Some of the key aspects evaluated include computation of research journals indexed each year during the period of study, their corresponding growth, subject wise distribution of OA journals, leading OA journals publishing countries and various other related aspects have been evaluated. From the data analysis it emerged that in 2002, 22 OA journals were indexed in DOAJ and on July 17, 2021 the date of data retrieval, the number of OA journals indexed were found 16,589, published across 126 countries. On average each year around 830 journals are indexed in DOAJ registering an average annual growth of around 51.46%. 46% journals were indexed during the last three years, reflecting exponential growth of OA research journals from 2018 onwards.	10.1007/s12109-022-09860-x	Pandita, R; Singh, S																					2022.0					10.1007/s12109-022-09860-x			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none  	t=none	geo=all							
2941	WoS	A validation study on the factors affecting the practice modes of open peer review	Open peer review; Transparent peer review; Practice mode	In this paper we conduct a validation study on the factors affecting the practice modes of open peer review. Taking the Open Access Journals (OAJ) in Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) as the research objects, we crawled the internet to gather their relevant data. Based on the method of categorical variable assignment, a quantitative analysis was performed on the qualitative factors that affect the practice modes of open peer review. A multi-dimensional analysis chart is used to illustrate the relationships between the factors. Optimal scale regression modeling and discriminant analysis were also employed to reveal the degrees of influences by the factors. The public categories of type of open peer review and reviewer identity are closely related to each other. Reviewer identity has evident positive influence on type of open peer review, and the degree of influence is the highest. Therefore, reviewer identity is the primary and most crucial factor affecting open peer review practice modes. Review report and order of review report and publication are the secondary ones. Whether or not the identities of review experts are open has become the most important factor affecting the practice modes of open peer review. Transparent peer review is currently the most effective practice mode of open peer review. Technologies like block chain can be used to address the psychological uneasiness for the peer review experts who are concerned with privacy issues. The fact that most OAJs use pre-publication review shows that open peer review still plays the traditional role of academic goalkeeper. Publication of peer review reports actually helps peer review experts augment their reputation, which in turn practically promotes the development of open peer review.	10.1007/s11192-022-04552-x	He, Y; Tian, K; Xu, XR																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-022-04552-x			44958	a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openmethod	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all

We compared the universities' institutional repository content focusing on the ratio of the number of deposited master's theses to the number of enrolled students taking into account the open access policies, or more specifically, the national and the universities' mandates to deposit master's theses. The research methods involved a quantitative approach where the data were collected through direct communication with universities' employees and from the institutional repositories in our sample. Our analysis showed that the number of papers stored in repositories reflects the open access policy, or more specifically, the master's theses deposit policy, at certain universities. Furthermore, when analyzing the distribution of the number of theses across the scientific disciplines as well as the degree of openness it was evident that it largely concurred with the trends recorded in the current scholarly literature.	10.1007/s00799-022-00340-3	Gudelj, D; Matosic, M; Poljak, L; Tomic, V; Marusic, A; Marusic, M																					2022.0					10.1007/s00799-022-00340-3			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=university	geo=EU	should interview be included they only clarified a few things	a=openaccess AND a=openpolicies	m=biblio AND m=document review AND m=interview 	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=med AND d=agric AND d=socscie AND d=hum	t=none	geo=FRA AND geo=ESP AND geo=DEU AND geo=MLT AND geo=HRV

As specific objectives, it is intended to point out public policies adopted in the state universities of Sao Paulo and to identify how these institutions define their guidelines related to new forms of data and information sharing. As data collection procedures, bibliographic research and documentary survey are used. In addition, we sent to the managers of the three selected universities, via the Citizen Information Service (SIC), a request to share information about the Open Science initiatives and strategies developed by these institutions. For the analysis, we categorized and classified the data collected through the five currents of thought that represent perspectives recognized by the authors Fecher and Friesike (2013). The data were treated in an Excel spreadsheet and interpreted with the help of a set of tools in the Power BI business intelligence clouds. It was concluded that the investigated universities have a great focus on research and, therefore, are seriously involved in several movements focused on Open Science.	10.19132/1808-5245272.164-192	Ribeiro, Nivaldo Calixto; Oliveira, Dalgiza Andrade; de Oliveira Santos, Sarah Rubia				J		EM QUESTAO	Portuguese	Article				[Ribeiro, Nivaldo Calixto; Oliveira, Dalgiza Andrade; de Oliveira Santos, Sarah Rubia] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil		36.0	0.0	UNIV FEDERAL RIO GRANDE SUL, FAC BIBLIOTECONOMIA & COMUNICACAO	PORTO ALEGRE	RUA RAMIRO BARCELOS, 2705, SALA 519, PORTO ALEGRE, RS 90040-060, BRAZIL	1807-8893		2021.0	27.0	2	164.0	192.0	10.19132/1808-5245272.164-192	WOS:000635191500008		44958	a=openscience	m=biblio; m=survey	d=none	t=university	d=BRA	The articles is in Portuguese so I based the codes on abstract only and not sure if entirely correct	a=opendata AND a=openpolicies	m=biblio AND m=document review	d=none	t=none

The main findings are that the approach given to open science has different aspects: policy framing and its geopolitical aspects are described as an asymmetries replication and epistemic governance tool. The main geopolitical aspects of open science policies described in the literature are the relations between international, regional, and national policies. There are also different components of open science covered in the literature: open data seems much discussed in the works in the English language, while open access is the main component discussed in the Portuguese and Spanish speaking papers. Finally, the relationship between open science policies and the science policy is framed by highlighting the innovation and transparency that open science can bring into it.	10.1177/21582440221140358	Manco, A.																					2022.0					10.1177/21582440221140358			44960	a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openpolicies AND a=openscience	m=biblio AND m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
2949	WoS	A light in the dark: open access to medical literature and the COVID-19 pandemic		Introduction. This study was designed to evaluate the accessibility of peer-reviewed literature regarding COVID-19 and the ten diseases with the highest death toll worldwide. Method. We conducted extensive searches of studies concerning COVID-19 and other diseases using the Web of Science, and the Google and Google Scholar search engines. Analysis. Open access rates were obtained from the Web of Science database, taking into account different types of publications and research areas. Quantitative analyses based on random samplings were used to estimate the potential increase of open access rates achievable with open archiving of post-prints. Results. The open access rate of COVID-19 papers (89.5%) largely outnumbered that of the ten most deadly human diseases (48.8%, on average). We estimated that most of the gap (70%) could be bridged by making available online, post-print manuscripts. Conclusions. The pandemic represents a real breakthrough, in scientific publishing, towards the goal of health information for all, demonstrating that much greater access to medical literature is possible. The green road may be the best way to bring open access rates of peer review of other major diseases closer to that of COVID-19. However, it needs to be implemented more effectively, combining bottom-up and top-down actions and making the open science culture more widespread.	10.47989/irpaper929	Capocasa, M; Anagnostou, P; Bisol, GD																					2022.0					10.47989/irpaper929			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=none							
2950	WoS	A longitudinal study of the evolution of opinions about open access and its main features: a twitter sentiment analysis	Open access; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Tweets	The present study aimed to explore how tweeters' opinions about open access publishing and its main features evolved over time. Using a quantitative content analysis method through an opinion mining approach, it explored a sample of English tweets on open access posted from 2007 to December 2019. The main terms related to open access were first identified through reviewing the related literature and were then categorized into five features including costs & funding, impact, models, publishing & publications, and quality & quality control. The terms were composed in the form of search formulae. The searches on Twitter led to retrieving 629,123 tweets. A cleansing process was carried out to remove duplicates, non-English, and low-relevant tweets. The final sample reached 80,629 tweets. The tweets were then tagged with the five features. The KNIME data mining tool and SentiStrength were used respectively for processing the tweets' contents and calculating their opinion scores. According to the results, the open-access-related tweets have been growing based on a sigmoidal model. They were mostly neutral and opinion tweets were far lower in number. The tweets in different polarities have been increasing based on a power-law model, with the negative tweets experiencing a disproportionately higher increase. The positive and negative opinions have remained almost stable in strength, with the former being stronger. The results were almost in line with the previous surveys confirming the co-existence of the positive and negative attitudes about open access. However, the social sphere has been gradually becoming more negative. As attitudes are likely to go viral on social networks, and thereby affect users' perceptions and behaviors, the results call for devising appropriate measures to empower the movement and to find solutions for the problems and concerns leading to the negative opinions.	10.1007/s11192-022-04502-7	Sotudeh, H; Saber, Z; Aloni, FG; Mirzabeigi, M; Khunjush, F																					2022.0					10.1007/s11192-022-04502-7			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
2952	WoS	Altmetric study of the social repercussion of open access brazilian scientific journals [Estudo altmetrico de repercussao social das revistas cientÍficas brasileiras de acesso aberto]	Scientific journal; Open access; Altmetrics; Repercussion on the social web	Objective. Identify the altmetric indicator of the social impact of Brazilian open access scientific journals. Design/Methodology/Approach. The study origins in a survey of the ISSN Agency database, whose results confirmed the existence of 1,393 journals. After organizing the data in an Excel spreadsheet, using the Altmetrics. com Platform, the impact on the social web was verified. Results/Discussion. 100,454 mentions were revealed, referring to 548 magazines, Twitter being the most used social network; most magazines have between one and ten mentions; nine of the ten articles with the greatest repercussion are in English; the University of Sao Paulo was the most prominent publisher; and the area of knowledge with the most attention was Medical and Health Sciences. Conclusion. There was a precarious dissemination and scientific circulation of Brazilian open access journals, since more than half (61%) are not mentioned in the networks. This result leads to affirm that visibility must be worked on, considering that it influences the popularization of information and the society's interest in science. It is recommended that magazines use the different means of dissemination, thus increasing the degree of exposure on the social web. Originality/Value. The emergence of surveys able to measure the appropriation and use of the social web is interesting, because, nowadays, surveys indicate that the web presents itself as the digital environment in which users spend the most time when they are connected. Even with this effervescent trend, few studies address the subject with a focus on scientific journals.

2953	Scopus	A model for open access institutional repositories usage for university libraries in Ghana		The aim of this article was to develop a model for the usage of Open Access Institutional Repositories (OAIR) in university libraries in Ghana. The article adopted the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which was then modified to fit the study. The variables were adapted to improve the fit between data and the theoretical model, keeping the characteristics of TAM. Accessibility, availability and visibility were proposed in addition to the conventional variables of TAM. Positivist paradigm, quantitative methods research and survey design were used for the study. Simple random sampling and stratified random sampling were the sampling procedures and methods employed. A total of 998 respondents completed the questionnaires distributed. The questionnaire was used as a research instrument to gather relevant data for the study. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (multinomial logistic regression and Confirmatory Factor Analysis [CFA], using structural equation modelling [SEM]) were used as statistical tools to analyse the data. The study developed an OAIR Usage Model, which would be instrumental in the usage of OAIR in university libraries in Ghana. The model will enhance both user satisfaction and intention to reuse the OAIR, and make OAIR research outputs available, accessible and visible. This article adds to the body of literature on OAIR, as it is used in university libraries. © The Author(s) 2020.	10.1177/0266666920937343	Ntim, K.K.; Fombad, M.

2954	WoS	Amplifying research influence through the social network, open access publishing, and international collaboration: A mediation analysis on nursing studies literature	bibliometric analysis; nursing research; research impact	Introduction Research impact and influence are commonly measured quantitatively by citation count received by research articles. Many institutes also use citation count as one of the factors in faculty performance appraisal and candidate selection of academic positions. Various strategies were recommended to amplify and accelerate research influence, particularly citation counts, by bringing research articles to a wider reach for potential readers. However, no prior empirical study was conducted to examine and valid effects of those strategies on nursing studies. This study examines and verifies the direct effects and mediation effects of some strategies, namely, the use of Twitter, international collaboration, the use of ResearchGate, and open access publishing, for amplifying the citation of research and review articles in nursing studies. Design Cross-sectional study design. Methods Articles published in top nursing journals in 2016 were identified in PUBMED and the citation metrics for individual articles until 2021 were extracted from Scopus. The primary outcome was the citation count of the article, while the tweet count on Twitter of the article was considered a mediator. The predictors included paper type, the total number of authors, the proportion of authors with a ResearchGate account in the article, funding support, open-accessed article, and the number of different countries stated in the authors' affiliation. A mediation analysis was conducted to examine the predictors' direct and indirect effects (i.e., via tweet count) on the citation count of the article. Results A total of 2210 articles were included in this study, of which 223 (10.1%) were review articles. The median (IQR) number of Scopus citations, tweets, countries, and percentage of authors with ResearchGate accounts were 12 (6-21), 2 (0-6), 1 (1-1), and 75% (50%-100%) respectively. In the mediation analysis, tweet count, article type, number of countries, percentage of authors with a ResearchGate account, and journal impact factors in 2014 were positively associated with the Scopus citation count. The effects of article type, open access, and journals' impact factors in 2014 on Scopus citation count were mediated by the tweet count. Conclusion This study provides empirical support for some strategies researchers may employ to amplify the citation count of their research articles. The methodology of our study can be extended to compare research influence between entities (e.g., across countries or institutes). Clinical Relevance The citation refers to the research work cited by peers and is one of the indicators for research impact. Higher citations implied the research work is read and used by others, therefore, understanding the associated factors with higher citations is critical.	10.1111/jnu.12827	Tang, A; Li, KK; Han, S; Kwok, KO; Tung, N; Tam, W																					2022.0					10.1111/jnu.12827			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
2956	WoS	An empirical meta-analysis of the life sciences linked open data on the web		While the biomedical community has published several open data sources in the last decade, most researchers still endure severe logistical and technical challenges to discover, query, and integrate heterogeneous data and knowledge from multiple sources. To tackle these challenges, the community has experimented with Semantic Web and linked data technologies to create the Life Sciences Linked Open Data (LSLOD) cloud. In this paper, we extract schemas from more than 80 biomedical linked open data sources into an LSLOD schema graph and conduct an empirical meta-analysis to evaluate the extent of semantic heterogeneity across the LSLOD cloud. We observe that several LSLOD sources exist as stand-alone data sources that are not inter-linked with other sources, use unpublished schemas with minimal reuse or mappings, and have elements that are not useful for data integration from a biomedical perspective. We envision that the LSLOD schema graph and the findings from this research will aid researchers who wish to query and integrate data and knowledge from multiple biomedical sources simultaneously on the Web.	10.1038/s41597-021-00797-y	Kamdar, Maulik R.; Musen, Mark A.

It explains the magnitude of the 2014-2020 business faculty OA and non-OA publications and their relative scholarly impact and metrics. The continued increase in the volume of OA articles suggests that professors are gradually accepting these article types, and that altmetric and CiteScore journal ranking metrics data may strengthen strategic initiatives for business librarians to assist faculties and university libraries in collective decision-making processes.

2960	WoS	A Statistical Analysis of the Campus-Based Open Access Fund at Boston College		In 2018, the Boston College Libraries launched a fund totaling $20,000 per semester to support affiliated researchers for their publications in open access (OA) journals. The BC OA Fund has experienced an increasing depletion rate as well as usage inefficiency. In this study, we seek to better understand these usage patterns by analyzing the OA applications received in the past three semesters. Specifically, we utilize two-sample t-tests and multiple linear regressions to perform a quantitative study of the depletion rate of the BC OA Fund and consider multiple factors affecting the efficiency of fund usage, including manuscript status, applicant's discipline, applicant's position, and co-authorship. Our results indicate that the OA Fund is becoming more popular within the BC community, especially among researchers in science and social science fields, and that a researcher's status as student and their co-authorship significantly improve usage efficiency.	10.1353/lib.2022.0003	Luo, JB; O'Connor, J; Melton, S; Kowal, KC																					2022.0					10.1353/lib.2022.0003			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=USA	This study investigates ans OA Fund, so unsure if a=openpolicies and/a=openevaluation should be added or not	a=openaccess AND a=openpolicies	m=document review	d=none	t=none	geo=USA							
2980	Scopus	Analysis of Open Access Data Sources for Application in Precision Agriculture	Agricultural robots; Agriculture applications; Crop monitoring; Crops; Data-source; Data-sources; Environmental data; Environmental technology; Microclimate data; Open Data; Physical sensors; Precision agriculture; Soil temperature	Precision agriculture uses new technologies to improve crop yields and increase profitability for farmers while reducing the inputs required to grow crops, such as land, water, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. Environmental microclimate data (e.g., air and soil temperature or moisture) are needed as inputs to precision agriculture applications so that adequate decisions and agrotechnical measures can be applied in the fields. Most of the existing precision agriculture solutions for environmental and crop monitoring use locally deployed sensors as the main data source. Since the deployment and maintenance of physical sensors in the fields potentially involves significant costs and human effort, open-access data sources may be an effective complement to environmental data from deployed sensors, but the question remains whether open-access data sources are comparable to locally deployed sensors in terms of accuracy. This paper analyzes the correlation between open environmental data sources provided by the Copernicus ERA5-Land and Agri4Cast data sets, and data collected by locally deployed sensors to determine the extent to which open data sources can be used in precision agriculture. © 2021 University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing.	10.23919/ConTEL52528.2021.9495978	Skocir, P.; Mandaric, K.; Kralj, I.; Zarko, I.P.; Jezic, G.

2988	WoS	Applying Appraisal Theory for the Interpretation of Experienced Researchers' Interviews on Open Access	Appraisal Theory; Spoken Discourse Analysis in Spanish and Catalan; Interviews; Open Access	Interviews are a recognized and valued method for obtaining research data. Usually, these data are drawn from the content of interviews. However, words and prosodic elements that accompany them may reveal complementary, and even contradictory information, that substantially alters the researcher???s first impression. After the publication in September of 2018 of the document COAlition Plan S which announced that research results funded by European institutions would have to be published in Open Access from 1 January 2020 (later postponed to 2021), 10 experienced researchers were interviewed on this topic. It is these interviews that will be the focus of this paper: the interviewees??? discourse and its meaning. To develop this research, the Appraisal Theory (Martin & White, 2005) was selected. Even though it was originally designed to study the English language, the Appraisal Theory framework proved to be very useful for analysing the researchers??? attitudes towards Open Access (OA) through several Spanish and Catalan language strategies. In addition, as interviews were audio recorded, it was decided to complement the linguistic analysis by paying attention to paralinguistic resources. The multimodal analysis of Appraisal in these researchers??? opinions reveals the dilemma they are faced with, either to publish in a limited number of less prestigious journals using Open Access, or to pay very high fees to use Gold Open Access.	10.4067/S0718-09342022000200481	Fortanet-Gomez, I																					2022.0					10.4067/S0718-09342022000200481			44958	a=openaccess	m=interview	d=hum	t=researcher	geo=ESP		a=openaccess	m=interview	d=med AND d=socscie AND d=natscie AND d=hum	t=researcher	geo=ESP

Article processing charges; Citations; CiteScore; Clarivate; Correlation; Journal-based metric; Journal Impact Factor (JIF); Prediction; Regression; Scopus; Web of Science	UK-based Hindawi (now part of Wiley) is one of the larger open access (OA) publishers that levies article processing charges (APCs) for publication in its 220 OA journals. The APCs range between US$650 and US$2300, with a median of US$950. We assessed if there is a link between the APC of I I indawi journals and two metrics, Elsevier's Scopus CiteScore, and Clarivate's Journal Impact Factor (JIF). Whereas 163 journals have a CiteScore (median APC = US$1000), 71 have a JIF (median APC = US$1950), while others with neither a CiteScore nor a JIF (NCNJ) have a median APC of US$650. The APC of journals with a CiteScore differed significantly from those with a JIF. We found a significant positive correlation between CiteScore and AFPC (r = 0.223, p < 0.01), but a weak non-significant positive correlation between JIF and APC (r = 0.162, p = 0.177). The Kruskal Wallis test showed that the medians of three groups (CiteScore, JIT and NCNJ) differed significantly from each other at p < 0.05.	10.1080/09737766.2022.2106164	Okagbue, HI; da Silva, JAT; Anake, TA																					2022.0					10.1080/09737766.2022.2106164			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=GBR		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
2991	WoS	Are journal archiving and embargo policies impeding the success of India's open access policy?	open access; article processing charge; embargo; green open access; hybrid open access; India	India's primary science funding agencies, the Department of Science & Technology, and the Department of Biotechnology (DST & DBT) together formulated an open access (OA) policy in 2014. This policy mandates immediate self-archival of research articles generated from publicly funded research across all the institutions in suitable repositories. But with inadequate infrastructure and awareness, the OA mandate did not flourish as expected. This paper aims to understand whether journal policies impede the prospect of DST-DBT OA policy and the possible routes to achieve policy compliance. The analysis presented in this paper tracks down the journal self-archiving policies of the top 50 popular journals (among Indian authors) from each of the six STEM fields-Biology, Chemistry, Clinical-Medicine, Engineering, Materials science, and Physics. The results show that most journals have an embargo of 12-24 months on self-archiving of the post-print (final author version after peer-review), which contradicts the DST-DBT OA mandate. The study also reveals that hybrid journals dominate, and article processing charges craft a new form of inequity for Indian STEM researchers. We expect that these findings will be helpful for the funding agencies to restructure their policies, and negotiate with journal publishers to resolve the contradictions.	0.1002/leap.1441	Koley, M; Lala, K																					2022.0					10.1002/leap.1441			44958	a=openaccess	m=document review	d=natscie; d=engtech	t=none	geo=IND		a=openaccess AND a=openpolicies	m=biblio	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=med	t=none	geo=IND							
2993	WoS	Are we all on the same page? Subfield differences in open science practices in psychology	developmental psychology; open data; open materials; subfield differences	Although open science has become a popular tool to combat the replication crisis, it is unclear whether the uptake of open science practices has been consistent across the field of psychology. In this study, we were particularly interested in whether claims that developmental psychology lags behind other subfields in adopting open science practices were valid. To test this, we determined whether data and material sharing differed as a function of psychological subfield at the distinguished journal, Psychological Science. The results showed that open data and open materials scores increased from 2014-2015 to 2019-2020. Of note, articles published in the field of developmental psychology generated lower open data and open materials scores than articles published in cognition; however, scores were similar to articles published in social psychology. Across Psychological Science articles, shared data and materials were seldom accompanied by documentation that is likely to make shared research objects useful. These findings are discussed in the context of the unique challenges faces by developmental psychologists and how journals can more effectively encourage authors to practice open science across psychology.	10.1002/icd.2361	Rochios, C; Richmond, JL																					2022.0					10.1002/icd.2361			44958	a=opendata; a=openmethod	m=biblio	d=socscie	t=none	geo=all		a=opendata AND a=openmethod AND a=opensoftware	m=biblio	d=socscie	t=none	geo=all							
2994	WoS	Are we paying-to-play? A quantitative assessment of Canadian open access research in ecology and evolution	publishing; article processing charges; journals; bibliometrics; H-index	Open access (OA) allows for peer- reviewed research to be freely accessed and there has been a collective shift from both researchers and publishers towards more OA publishing. OA typically occurs either through article-processing charges (the gold road) or via self-archiving (the green road); the former can be expensive, while the latter has seen minimal uptake. The gold road of OA has led to predatory publishers and, to some, questionable publications. Here, I used publicly available grant information in Canada and combined this with individual publishing statistics to test a variety of factors and their influence on OA publishing. I showed that an individual's award amount, H-index, and gender did not influence the proportion of OA articles they published, but an individual's H-index scaled with the number of OA publications. Institute size influenced OA publishing patterns, with researchers at large universities (i. e., >20 000 full-time students) publishing proportionately more OA articles than medium and small institutes. I discuss the potential for this pattern to build on pre-existing systemic biases when it comes to funding and publishing.	10.1139/facets-2020-0040	Shafer, Aaron B. A.

2996	WoS	Assessing Open Access Friendliness of National Institutes of Technology (NITs): A Data Carpentry Approach	Open access; Open access indicators; Open access friendliness; Data carpentry; OpenRefine	This research study aims to measure the Open Access (OA) friendliness of National Institutes of Technology (NITs) of India that are listed in the overall category of NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework), 2021 by taking into consideration four important OA parameters - i) OA publication share; ii) OA licensing scenario; iii) citation impact of OA publications; and iv) altmetric scores of OA publications. It deals with 64,485 publications of the selected 11 NITs during the period from 2012 to 2021 (10 years), citations received by these publications (5,42,638 citations), and altmetric attention scores of the documents (5,213 publications) during the period under study. A data carpentry tool, namely OpenRefine, and open access bibliographic/citation data sources such as Unpaywall, Dimensions, and Altmetric.com have been deployed to accomplish this large-scale study for ranking NITs by their Open Access Friendliness (OAF). The OAF indicator, as applied in this study, is a distributed weightage based 100-point scale built on top of the aforesaid OA parameters. The ranking framework shows that Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat (est. in 1961) has achieved the top position with a score of 52.12 (out of 100), but in totality only 3 NITs (out of the selected 11 NITs) crossed the 50 per cent mark in the adapted OAF scale.	10.14429/djlit.42.5.18263	Roy, A; Mukhopadhyay, P																					2022.0					10.14429/djlit.42.5.18263			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=engtech	t=none	geo=IND		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=engtech	t=none	geo=IND							
2997	WoS	Assessing Open Science practices in physical activity behaviour change intervention evaluations	open science; reproducibility; transparency; meta-research; physical activity; behaviour change	Objectives Concerns on the lack of reproducibility and transparency in science have led to a range of research practice reforms, broadly referred to as 'Open Science'. The extent that physical activity interventions are embedding Open Science practices is currently unknown. In this study, we randomly sampled 100 reports of recent physical activity randomised controlled trial behaviour change interventions to estimate the prevalence of Open Science practices. Methods One hundred reports of randomised controlled trial physical activity behaviour change interventions published between 2018 and 2021 were identified, as used within the Human Behaviour-Change Project. Open Science practices were coded in identified reports, including: study pre-registration, protocol sharing, data, materials and analysis scripts sharing, replication of a previous study, open access publication, funding sources and conflict of interest statements. Coding was performed by two independent researchers, with inter-rater reliability calculated using Krippendorff's alpha. Results 78 of the 100 reports provided details of study pre-registration and 41% provided evidence of a published protocol. 4% provided accessible open data, 8% provided open materials and 1% provided open analysis scripts. 73% of reports were published as open access and no studies were described as replication attempts. 93% of reports declared their sources of funding and 88% provided conflicts of interest statements. A Krippendorff's alpha of 0.73 was obtained across all coding. Conclusion Open data, materials, analysis and replication attempts are currently rare in physical activity behaviour change intervention reports, whereas funding source and conflict of interest declarations are common. Future physical activity research should increase the reproducibility of their methods and results by incorporating more Open Science practices.	10.1136/bmjsem-2021-001282	Norris, E; Sulevani, I; Finnerty, AN; Castro, O																					2022.0					10.1136/bmjsem-2021-001282			44958	a=openaccess; a=opendata; a=openmethod	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess AND a=opendata AND a=openmethod  	m=document review	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3003	WoS	Attitudes and practices of open data, preprinting, and peer-review-A cross sectional study on Croatian scientists		Attitudes towards open peer review, open data and use of preprints influence scientists' engagement with those practices. Yet there is a lack of validated questionnaires that measure these attitudes. The goal of our study was to construct and validate such a questionnaire and use it to assess attitudes of Croatian scientists. We first developed a 21-item questionnaire called Attitudes towards Open data sharing, preprinting, and peer-review (ATOPP), which had a reliable four-factor structure, and measured attitudes towards open data, preprint servers, open peer-review and open peer-review in small scientific communities. We then used the ATOPP to explore attitudes of Croatian scientists (n = 541) towards these topics, and to assess the association of their attitudes with their open science practices and demographic information. Overall, Croatian scientists' attitudes towards these topics were generally neutral, with a median (Md) score of 3.3 out of max 5 on the scale score. We also found no gender (P = 0.995) or field differences (P = 0.523) in their attitudes. However, attitudes of scientist who previously engaged in open peer-review or preprinting were higher than of scientists that did not (Md 3.5 vs. 3.3, P<0.001, and Md 3.6 vs 3.3, P<0.001, respectively). Further research is needed to determine optimal ways of increasing scientists' attitudes and their open science practices.	10.1371/journal.pone.0244529	Bazdaric, Ksenija; Vrkic, Iva; Arh, Evgenia; Mavrinac, Martina; Markovic, Maja Gligora; Bilic-Zulle, Lidija; Stojanovski, Jadranka; Malicki, Mario				J		PLOS ONE	English	Article				[Bazdaric, Ksenija; Mavrinac, Martina; Markovic, Maja Gligora; Bilic-Zulle, Lidija] Univ Rijeka, Fac Med, Dept Med Informat, Rijeka, Croatia; [Vrkic, Iva] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Geophys, Zagreb, Croatia; [Arh, Evgenia] Univ Rijeka, Fac Med, Lib, Rijeka, Croatia; [Stojanovski, Jadranka] Univ Zadar, Dept Informat Sci, Zadar, Croatia; [Stojanovski, Jadranka] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Ctr Sci Informat, Zagreb, Croatia; [Malicki, Mario] Stanford Univ, Metares Innovat Ctr Stanford METRICS, Stanford, CA 94305 USA		66.0	0.0	PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE	SAN FRANCISCO	1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA	1932-6203		2021.0	16.0	6			10.1371/journal.pone.0244529	WOS:000671691000015	34153041.0	44958	a=openaccess; a=opendata; a=openevaluation	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=HRV	open preprints?	a=openaccess AND a=opendata AND a=openevaluation AND a=openmethod	m=survey	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=med AND d=agric AND d=socscie AND d=hum	t=researcher	geo=HRV							
3004	Scopus	Attitudes toward open peer review among stakeholders of a scholar-led journal in Brazil [Atitudes perante a revisão por pares aberta entre as partes interessadas em uma revista acadêmica no Brasil]		Scholarly journals should consider the attitudes of their communities before adopting any of the seven traits of open peer review. Unfortunately, surveys from the Global North might not apply to the Global South, where double-blind peer review is commonplace even among natural sciences and medicine journals. This paper reports the findings of a survey on attitudes toward open peer review among four stakeholder groups of a scholar-led medical journal in Brazil: society members, journal readers, authors, and reviewers. Compared to a previous survey, which mostly recruited natural sciences researchers from Europe, this survey found similar support for open peer review in general and for most of its traits. One important exception was open identities, which were considered detrimental by most participants, even more in this survey than in the previous one. Interestingly, participants were more dismissive of open identities as a whole than of statements about its specific consequences. Because preprints are increasingly popular but incompatible with double-blind review, future research should examine the effects of transitioning from double-blind to open identities, especially on gender bias. Meanwhile, scholarly journals with double-blind review might prefer to begin by adopting other traits of open review or to make open identities optional at first. © 2021 Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas.

3005	WoS	Attitudes, willingness, and resources to cover article publishing charges: The influence of age, position, income level country, discipline and open access habits	article publishing charges; gold OA; open access	The rise of open access (OA) publishing has been followed by the expansion of the Article Publishing Charges (APC) that moves the financial burden of scholarly journal publishing from libraries and readers to authors. We introduce the results of an international randomly selected sampled survey (N = 3,422) that explores attitudes towards this pay-to-publish or Gold OA model among scholars. We test the predictor role of age, professional position, discipline, and income-level country in this regard. We found that APCs are perceived more as a global threat to Science than a deterrent to personal professional careers. Academics in low and lower-middle income level countries hold the most unfavourable opinions about the APC system. The less experimental disciplines held more negative perceptions of APC compared to STEM and the Life Sciences. Age and access to external funding stood as negative predictors of refusal to pay to publish. Commitment to OA self-archiving predicted the negative global perception of the APC. We conclude that access to external research funds influences the acceptance and the particular perception of the pay to publish model, remarking the economic dimension of the problem and warning about issues in the inequality between centre and periphery.	10.1002/leap.1455	Segado-Boj, F; Prieto-Gutierrez, JJ; Martin-Quevedo, J																					2022.0					10.1002/leap.1455			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=med AND d=agric AND d=socscie AND d=hum	t=researcher	geo=AF AND geo=NA AND geo=OC AND geo=AS AND geo=EU AND geo=SA							
3006	Scopus	Attracting new users or business as usual? A case study of converting academic subscription-based journals to open access		This paper studies a selection of 11 Norwegian journals in the humanities and social sciences and their conversion from subscription to open access, a move heavily incentivized by governmental mandates and open access policies. By investigating the journals’ visiting logs in the period 2014– 2019, the study finds that a conversion to open access induces higher visiting numbers; all journals in the study had a significant increase, which can be attributed to the conversion. Converting a journal had no spillover in terms of increased visits to previously published articles still behind the paywall in the same journals. Visits from previously subscribing Norwegian higher education institutions did not account for the increase in visits, indicating that the increase must be accounted for by visitors from other sectors. The results could be relevant for policymakers concerning the effects of strict policies targeting economically vulnerable national journals, and could further inform journal owners and editors on the effects of converting to open access. © 2021 Lars Wenaas.	10.1162/qss_a_00126	Wenaas, L.

3012	Scopus	Awareness and Perceptions of Korean Researchers on Open Access	Korean researchers; Oa policy; Open access; Perceptions; Publishing	This study aims to determine the awareness and perceptions of Korean researchers regarding mandatory open access (OA) and OA publishing of publicly-funded research papers. In July 2019, Korean researchers who had published in Science Citation Index Expanded journals as first authors and corresponding authors participated in an online survey distributed via e-mail. A total of 1,172 valid responses were collected and analyzed using SPSS 18. The results indicated that the level of awareness of OA differed significantly based on occupation and research experience (p<0.001). Although 52.56% of the respondents had experienced OA publishing, only 22.35% had self-archiving experience. Regardless of the amount of publishing cost support, researchers showed a high level of willingness to publish OA articles. Yet, since the importance of impact factor was evaluated to be very high, at present OA publication might have a limited role as a publication platform. © Mikyeong Cha, Soon Hee Pyo, Hye Sun Kim, Wan Jong Kim, Eun Jee Lee, 2022	10.1633/JISTaP.2022.10.3.6	Cha M., Kim H.S., Lee E.J., Pyo S.H., Kim W.J.																					2022.0					10.1633/JISTaP.2022.10.3.6			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=KOR		a=openacces	m=survey	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=med	t=researcher	geo=KOR							
3013	WoS	Awareness of predatory journals and open access publishing among orthopaedic and trauma surgeons - results from an online survey in Germany	Awareness of predatory journals; Orthopaedic and trauma surgeons; Online survey; Open access journals	BackgroundAlong with emerging open access journals (OAJ) predatory journals increasingly appear. As they harm accurate and good scientific research, we aimed to examine the awareness of predatory journals and open access publishing among orthopaedic and trauma surgeons.MethodsIn an online survey between August and December 2019 the knowledge on predatory journals and OAJ was tested with a hyperlink made available to the participants via the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) email distributor.ResultsThree hundred fifty orthopaedic and trauma surgeons participated, of which 291 complete responses (231 males (79.4%), 54 females (18.6%) and 5N/A (2.0%)) were obtained. 39.9% were aware of predatory journals. However, 21.0% knew about the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) as a register for non-predatory open access journals. The level of profession (e.g. clinic director, consultant) (p =0.018) influenced the awareness of predatory journals. Interestingly, participants aware of predatory journals had more often been listed as corresponding authors (p <0.001) and were well published as first or last author (p <0.001). Awareness of OAJ was masked when journal selection options did not to provide any information on the editorial board, the peer review process or the publication costs.ConclusionThe impending hazard of predatory journals is unknown to many orthopaedic and trauma surgeons. Early stage clinical researchers must be trained to differentiate between predatory and scientifically accurate journals.	10.1186/s12891-021-04223-7	Maurer, Elke; Walter, Nike; Histing, Tina; Anastasopoulou, Lydia; El Khassawna, Thaqif; Wenzel, Lisa; Alt, Volker; Rupp, Markus				J		BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS	English	Article				[Maurer, Elke; Histing, Tina] Eberhard Karls Univ Tuebingen, Dept Trauma & Reconstruct Surg, BG Unfallklin Tuebingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Walter, Nike; Alt, Volker; Rupp, Markus] Univ Med Ctr Regensburg, Dept Trauma Surg, Regensburg, Germany; [Anastasopoulou, Lydia] Univ Hosp Giessen, Dept Trauma Hand & Reconstruct Surg, Giessen, Germany; [El Khassawna, Thaqif] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Expt Trauma Surg, Giessen, Germany; [El Khassawna, Thaqif] Univ Appl Sci, Fac Hlth Sci, Giessen, Germany; [Wenzel, Lisa] BG Trauma Ctr Murnau, Dept Trauma & Reconstruct Surg, Murnau Am Staffelsee, Germany		15.0	0.0	BMC	LONDON	CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND			2021.0	22.0	1			10.1186/s12891-021-04223-7	WOS:000641735100004	33865338.0	44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=med	t=practitioner	geo=GER		a=openaccess	m=survey	d=med	t=researcher	geo=DEU							
3014	WoS	Awareness, use and attitudes of the Indian higher educational institutions students about scholarly open access: an empirical analysis	Open access movement; Open access models; Scholarly communication; Students; Higher education institutions; India	Purpose Open access is a new scholarly publishing model that has appeared in place of the commercial publishing model. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of awareness, use and attitudes of the Indian students in higher educational institutions about scholarly open access. Design/methodology/approach Survey method was used in the study. The sample population of the study was 212 Indian students belonging to different higher educational institutions in India. Findings The results of the study reveal a gloomy picture about the open access (OA) awareness and use among Indian students. Unfamiliarity with the OA journals and high publication fee were the main obstacles for the students not to publish in OA journals. However, a majority of the students reported their willingness to publish in OA journals in future if the obstacles are removed. A very meager ratio of the respondents had published in OA journals so far. In addition, motivational factors for publishing in OA journals were also taken into consideration, and respondent's indicated winning research grants, great impact and higher citations as main factors to publish in OA journals. Research limitations/implications This study is geographically limited to the students of the higher educational institutions located in India. Practical implications This study will help to understand the involvement and behavior of the Indian students toward scholarly open access. The study will also guide what measures need to be taken in the take up of open access movement. Originality/value Institutional repositories appeared to be relatively a novel term for the respondents, and in order to get the citation advantages and higher visibility, librarians can make an effort to persuade students to publish their research work in open access journals and institutional/subject repositories. The study recommends that institutions need to take appropriate measures to inform students about the importance and overall benefits associated with using of OA platforms in their scholarly work.	10.1108/LM-12-2021-0107	Palla, IA; Sheikh, A; Baquee, A																					2022.0					10.1108/LM-12-2021-0107			44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=other	geo=IND	No OA to article so codes are based on abstract only	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=other	geo=IND							
3018	Scopus	Barriers to Full Participation in the Open Science Life Cycle among Early Career Researchers	Barriers; Early Career Researcher; Open Data; Open Publishing; Open Science; Reproducibility	Open science (OS) is currently dominated by a small subset of practices that occur late in the scientific process. Early career researchers (ECRs) will play a key role in transitioning the scientific community to more widespread use of OS from pre-registration to publication, but they also face unique challenges in adopting these practices. Here, we discuss these challenges across the OS life cycle. Our essay relies on the published literature, an informal survey of 32 ECRs from 14 countries, and discussions among members of the Global Working Group on Open Science (Global Young Academy and National Young Academies). We break the OS life cycle into four stages—study design and tracking (pre-registration, open processes), data collection (citizen science, open hardware, open software, open data), publication (open access publishing, open peer review, open data), and outreach (open educational resources, citizen science)—and map potential barriers at each stage. The most frequently discussed barriers across the OS life cycle were a lack of awareness and training, prohibitively high time commitments, and restrictions and/or a lack of incentives by supervisors. We found that OS practices are highly fragmented and that awareness is particularly low for OS practices that occur during the study design and tracking stage, possibly creating ‘path-dependencies’ that reduce the likelihood of OS practices at later stages. We note that, because ECRs face unique barriers to adopting OS, there is a need for specifically targeted policies such as mandatory training at the graduate level and promotion incentives. © 2022 The Author(s).	10.5334/dsj-2022-002	Gownaris N.J., Vermeir K., Bittner M.-I., Gunawardena L., Kaur-Ghumaan S., Lepenies R., Ntsefong G.N., Zakari I.S.																					2022.0					10.5334/dsj-2022-002			44958	a=openmethod; a=openaccess; a=opendata; a=openeducation	m=survey	d=none	t=researcher	geo=all		a=openaccess AND a=opendata AND a=openmethod AND a=openevaluation AND a=opensoftware AND a=opentools AND a=openeducation AND a=openparticipation	m=survey AND m=interview AND m=biblio	d=none	t=researcher	geo=all							
3020	WoS	Benefits of Using Open Access: Citation Analysis	open access; citation prediction; scientometric indicators; evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific activity; altmetrics	An assessment of the impact of open access (OA) on bibliometric indicators and the altmetrics of scientific publications is presented. The object of the study was the metadata of articles placed in the RSCI bibliographic database, selected according to the following conditions: (1) the article must correspond to the subject area pipeline transport (according to the SRNTI classification); (2) article metadata should contain 5-7 keywords among terms from the subject area; and (3) more than three years must pass from the date of publication of the article. The results of the study confirm to some extent that the use of open access increases the number of views of articles, expands the readership and contributes to the dissemination of knowledge. However, the long-term impact of OA does not show obvious improvements in terms of bibliometric growth. It has been established that the citation of articles published on the terms of OA and non-OA levels out after 3 years, and, over time, the type of publication will not significantly affect the bibliometric indicators.	10.3103/S0005105522040045	Komaritsa, VN																					2022.0					10.3103/S0005105522040045			44958	a=openaccess; a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=RUS		a=openaccess and a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=engtech	t=none	geo=all							
3023	WoS	Big in Japan, Zimbabwe or Brazil - global reach and national preferences for open access books	open access; books; globalization; internationalization; OAPEN Library	The perceived effect of internationalization on publishing is that there is a strong focus on global issues written in English only. In academic book publishing - strongly connected to the humanities and social sciences (HSS) - languages other than English play an important role. Non-English academic publications have been linked to regional issues: there is a tension between English as the 'lingua franca' enabling a global reach versus local languages that provide a better cultural 'fit'. This article examines the preference of global readers in a systematic manner, by examining the usage of the open access collection of the OAPEN Library. Based on the ten most downloaded books from 100 countries during a 12-month period, the focus on regional topics is measured using the number of books written in non-English languages and the amount of English language books that mention the country. The results show a global interest in books with a regional focus. In many countries, the ten most downloaded books are written in non-English languages. Even when English language titles are part of the top ten, many mention regional concerns. The article counters the narrative of the dominance of English as the language of scholarly communication. Instead, it supports the value of bibliodiversity.	10.1629/uksg.580	Snijder, R																					2022.0					10.1629/uksg.580			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=AF AND geo=NA AND geo=OC AND geo=AS AND geo=EU AND geo=SA							
3030	WoS	Bringing an Intersectional Lens to Open Science: An Analysis of Representation in the Reproducibility Project	open science; feminism; reproducibility; intersectionality; WEIRD; representation	Feminist psychologists have called for researchers to consider the social and historical context and the multidimensionality of participants in research studies. The Reproducibility Project documents the degree to which the findings from mainstream psychological studies are reproduced. Drawing on intersectionality theory, we question the value of reproducing findings while ignoring who is represented, intersecting social and group identities, sociohistorical context, and the power and privilege that likely influence participants' responses in psychology experiments. To critically examine the Reproducibility Project in psychology, we analyzed the 100 replication reports produced between 2011 and 2014 (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). We developed an intersectional analytic framework to investigate (a) representation, (b) whether demographic and identity factors were considered through a multidimensional or intersectional lens, (c) explanations of non-replication, and (d) whether socio-cultural context was considered. Results show that reports predominantly include WEIRD samples (people from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries). Context and identity were rarely considered, even when study design relied on these factors, and intersectional identities and structures (considering power, structural issues, discrimination, and historical context) were absent from nearly all reports.	10.1177/03616843211035678	Sabik, Natalie J.; Matsick, Jes L.; McCormick-Huhn, Kaitlin; Cole, Elizabeth R.

3042	WoS	Can transparency undermine peer review? A simulation model of scientist behavior under open peer review	peer review; science; reviewer bias; status; agent-based models	Transparency and accountability are keywords in corporate business, politics, and science. As part of the open science movement, many journals have started to adopt forms of open peer review beyond the closed (single- or double-blind) standard model. However, there is contrasting evidence on the impact of these innovations on the quality of peer review. Furthermore, their long-term consequences on scientists' cooperation and competition are difficult to assess empirically. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting an agent-based model that simulates competition and status dynamics between scholars in an artificial academic system. The results would suggest that if referees are sensitive to competition and status, the transparency achieved by open peer review could backfire on the quality of the process. Although only abstract and hypothetical, our findings suggest the importance of multidimensional values of peer review and the anonymity and confidentiality of the process.	10.1093/scipol/scac027	Bianchi, F; Squazzoni, F																					2022.0					10.1093/scipol/scac027			44958	a=openevaluation	m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=all	The study describes scenarios / simulations on open peer review, I'm not entirely sure if it should be included.	a=openmethod	m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3046	WoS	Challenges and opportunities of facilitating access and use of open access resources to users by librarians in federal and state universities in Nigeria	Nigeria; Facilitating access and use; Free content challenges; Free content opportunities; Metacognitive theory; Open access	Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the challenges and opportunities of librarians in federal and state universities in Nigeria in facilitating access to open access resources. Design/methodology/approach Using a positivist research paradigm, descriptive survey research approach was employed in the study. Five research questions guided the study. The population of the study was 79 librarians. There was no sampling. A questionnaire was used as instrument for data collection, and the data were presented in figures and tables. Findings The major findings of the study were that librarians are aware of open access resources. They make the resources available/visible to users by linking them to the library website and promote the use of Google and Google Scholar searches. The librarians were of the view that free online resources are important for the research process. The major challenges they face in giving users access to these resources are lack of metrics and evidence to demonstrate the value of free content. Research limitations/implications The study only assessed e-resources' librarians in the sampled universities at the time of this study. It may be necessary to assess the perception of users towards open access resources. Practical implications Adopting and implementing these opportunities to enhance users' access and use of the resources will improve service delivery without doubt. Though this study is not exhaustive, it has provided insight into the inherent opportunities of using open access resources. Originality/value For the library management and librarians, the creation of awareness on available open access resources and facilitating access to users through different strategies will not only increase access but also improve teaching, learning and research. It will also increase users' awareness on accessing other sources apart from through subscription.	10.1108/LM-03-2020-0039	Ukwoma, Scholastica Chizoma; Onyebinama, Colette Ogugua				J		LIBRARY MANAGEMENT	English	Article				[Ukwoma, Scholastica Chizoma] Univ Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe Lib, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Ukwoma, Scholastica Chizoma] Univ South Africa, Sch Interdisciplinary Res & Grad Studies, Pretoria, South Africa; [Onyebinama, Colette Ogugua] Univ Lib, Fed Univ Technol Owerri, Owerri, Nigeria		59.0	0.0	EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD	BINGLEY	HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND	0143-5124		2021.0	42.0	8-9	481.0	497.0	10.1108/LM-03-2020-0039	WOS:000674983500001		44958	a=openaccess	m=survey	d=none	t=librarian	geo=NGA		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=survey	d=none	t=librarian	geo=NGA							
3047	WoS	Challenges of Promoting Open Science within the NI4OS-Europe Project in Hungary	Hungary; NI4OS-Europe; EOSC; open science; science communication	National Initiatives for Open Science in Europe (NI4OS-Europe) is a Horizon 2020 project related to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). One of the project objectives is promoting EOSC and open science in 15 Central and East European EU states and EU-associated countries. This paper describes the variety of promoting activities carried out in Hungary as part of the NI4OS-Europe project by the Governmental Agency for IT Development (KIFu). Identifying good practices will give us the chance to find the best communication channels and methods to promote open science and to manage expectations of funders, researchers and librarians. The audience diversity of organized NI4OS events was analyzed in this study. The anonymized dataset based on registration forms was filtered by profession. Results suggest that events are generally visited by more librarians than researchers. The only exception is the third forum where the main Hungarian research fund as co-organizer might have attracted researchers' attention. This suggests that librarians are considered to be in charge of open science issues in general. Usage data of the open science news feed were also studied. The 130 posts between May 2021 and April 2022 and 2500 visitors until the end of June 2022 give us the chance to learn about the characteristics of the most visited posts. We can conclude that the focus of communication is on open and FAIR data management, while other areas receive less attention. The results show that despite more international posts being published, the target group is more interested in local information.	10.3390/publications10040051	Lencses, A; Suto, P																					2022.0					10.3390/publications10040051			44958	a=openscience	m=document review	d=none	t=researcher; t=librarian	geo=HUN		a=openscience AND a=openpolicies AND a=openevaluation	m=other	d=none	t=none	geo=HUN							
3048	WoS	Change and growth in open access journal publishing and charging trends 2011-2021		This study examines trends in open access article processing charges (APCs) from 2011 to 2021, building on a 2011 study by Solomon and Bjork. Two methods are employed, a modified replica and a status update of the 2011 journals. Data are drawn from multiple sources and datasets are available as open data. Most journals do not charge APCs; this has not changed. The global average per-journal APC increased slightly, from 906 to 958 USD, while the per-article average increased from 904 to 1,626 USD, indicating that authors choose to publish in more expensive journals. Publisher size, type, impact metrics and subject affect charging tendencies, average APC, and pricing trends. Half the journals from the 2011 sample are no longer listed in DOAJ in 2021, due to ceased publication or publisher de-listing. Conclusions include a caution about the potential of the APC model to increase costs beyond inflation. The university sector may be the most promising approach to economically sustainable no-fee OA journals. Universities publish many OA journals, nearly half of OA articles, tend not to charge APCs and when APCs are charged, the prices are very low on average.	10.1002/asi.24717	Morrison, H; Borges, L; Zhao, X; Kakou, TL; Shanbhoug, AN																					2022.0					10.1002/asi.24717			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openacces	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all							
3050	WoS	Changing the Academic Gender Narrative through Open Access	open access; publishing; gender bias; gender disparities; open research; open science; research productivity; academia; women	In this article, we ask whether dominant narratives of gender and performance within academic institutions are masking stories that may be both more complex and potentially more hopeful than those which are often told using publication-related data. Influenced by world university rankings, institutions emphasise so-called 'excellent' research practices: publish in 'high impact', elite subscription journals indexed by the commercial bibliographic databases that inform the various ranking systems. In particular, we ask whether data relating to institutional demographics and open access publications could support a different story about the roles that women are playing as pioneers and practitioners of open scholarship. We review gender bias in scholarly publications and discuss examples of open access research publications that highlight a positive advantage for women. Using analysis of workforce demographics and open research data from our Open Knowledge Initiative project, we explore relationships and correlations between academic gender and open access research output from universities in Australia and the United Kingdom. This opens a conversation about different possibilities and models for exploring research output by gender and changing the dominant narrative of deficit in academic publishing.	10.3390/publications10030022	Wilson, K; Huang, CK; Montgomery, L; Neylon, C; Handcock, RN; Ozaygen, A; Roelofs, A																					2022.0					10.3390/publications10030022			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=GBR; geo=AUS		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=none	t=researcher AND t=university	geo=AUS AND geo=GBR							
3053	WoS	Charting variety, scope, and impact of open access diamond journals in various disciplines and regions: a survey-based observational study	Access to information; Authorship; Data management; Diamond open access; Publishing	Purpose: The variety, scope, and impact of open access (OA) diamond journals across disciplines and regions from July 22 to September 11, 2020 were charted to characterize the current OA diamond landscape.Methods: The total number of diamond journals was estimated, including those outside the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The distribution across regions, disciplines, and publisher types was described. The scope of journals in terms of authorship and readership was investigated. Information was collected on linguistic diversity, journal dynamics and life cycle, and their visibility in scholarly databases.Results: The number of OA diamond journals is estimated to be 29,000. OA diamond journals are estimated to publish 356,000 articles per year. The OA diamond sector is diverse in terms of regions (45% in Europe, 25% in Latin America, 16% in Asia, and 5% in the United States/Cana-da) and disciplines (60% humanities and social sciences, 22% sciences, and 17% medicine). More than 70% of OA diamond journals are published by university-owned publishers, including uni-versity presses. The majority of OA diamond journals are small, publishing fewer than 25 articles a year. English (1,210), Spanish (492), and French (342) are the most common languages of the main texts. Out of 1,619 journals, 1,025 (63.3%) are indexed in DOAJ, 492 (30.4%) in Scopus, and 321 (19.8%) in Web of Science. Conclusion: The patterns and trends reported herein provide insights into the diversity and im-portance of the OA diamond journal landscape and the accompanying opportunities and chal-lenges in supporting this publishing model.	10.6087/kcse.277																						2022.0					10.6087/kcse.277			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess	m=survey AND m=interview	d=natscie AND d=engtech AND d=med AND d=agric AND d=socscie AND d=hum	t=publisher	geo=AF AND geo=NA AND geo=OC AND geo=AS AND geo=EU AND geo=SA							
3055	Scopus	Circumstantial reasoning: Creation and management of open access repositories in Peru [Razonamiento circunstancial Creación y gestión de repositorios de acceso abierto en Perú]	Bottom up; Circumstantial reasoning; Community; Information systems; Information use; Open access repository; OpenAccess; Research institutes; Science and technolgy study; Semi structured interviews; Social order; Technical order	Part of the results of a study on the creation of open access repositories in universities and research institutes in Peru are presented here. Fieldwork was conducted in ten institutions in 2014, through thirty long-term semi-structured interviews. The central argument is that the creation of repositories rests on the casual and informal use of ideas, people and artefacts in concrete circumstances, which are accountable by the very actors who were involved in them. From a relational standpoint, the creation of repositories can best be understood as an everyday phenomenon that takes shape from the margins (bottom-up), without a prior normative, social and technical order. © 2021 AISTI.	10.23919/CISTI52073.2021.9476555	Yrivarren, J.

3056	WoS	Citations and Author Characteristics in Open-Access and Subscription-Based Otolaryngology Journals	citation; h-index; open-access; otolaryngology	Objective To describe the academic impact and author characteristics of open-access journals in otolaryngology. Methods Original articles from three open-access (OTO Open, Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology, and World Journal of Otorhinolaryngology) and three conventional subscription-based otolaryngology specific journals (Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, The Laryngoscope, JAMA Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery) were assessed. Publication dates of articles from January 2017 to July 2020 were included. Google Scholar and Web of Science citation counts were recorded. H-indexes of first and last authors were included according to Google Scholar and Web of Science and analyzed. Results This analysis included 3284 articles. Articles published in open-access otolaryngology-specific journals had significantly fewer citations on average (6.8) than articles published in subscription-based journals (12.4, p < 0.0001). The last authors of articles published in subscription-based journals had significantly higher h-indexes (23.50) compared with the last authors of articles published in open-access journals (19.53, p < 0.0001). The first authors of articles published in open-access journals had similar h-indexes (10.26) as the first authors of articles published in subscription-based journals (10.33). Conclusions Articles published in open-access journals in otolaryngology were cited significantly less than those published in subscription-based journals. The h-index of the last authors was significantly lower in open-access journals; however, the h-index of the first authors was similar between open-access and subscription-based journals. As measured by citations, open-access publications do not yet appear to have the impact of subscription-based publications.

3058	Scopus	Close to open-Factors that hinder and promote open science in ecology research and education		The Open Science (OS) movement is rapidly gaining traction among policy-makers, research funders, scientific journals and individual scientists. Despite these tendencies, the pace of implementing OS throughout the scientific process and across the scientific community remains slow. Thus, a better understanding of the conditions that affect OS engagement, and in particular, of how practitioners learn, use, conduct and share research openly can guide those seeking to implement OS more broadly. We surveyed participants at an OS workshop hosted by the Living Norway Ecological Data Network in 2020 to learn how they perceived OS and its importance in their research, supervision and teaching. Further, we wanted to know what OS practices they had encountered in their education and what they saw as hindering or helping their engagement with OS. The survey contained scaledresponse and open-ended questions, allowing for a mixed-methods approach. We obtained survey responses from 60 out of 128 workshop participants (47%). Responses indicated that usage and sharing of open data and code, as well as open access publication, were the most frequent OS practices. Only a minority of respondents reported having encountered OS in their formal education. A majority also viewed OS as less important in their teaching than in their research and supervisory roles. The respondents' suggestions for what would facilitate greater OS engagement in the future included knowledge, guidelines, and resources, but also social and structural support. These are aspects that could be strengthened by promoting explicit implementation of OS practices in higher education and by nurturing a more inclusive and equitable OS culture. We argue that incorporating OS in teaching and learning of science can yield substantial benefits to the research community, student learning, and ultimately, to the wider societal objectives of science and higher education. © 2022 Stromme et al.

3064	WoS	Comparison of Open-access Databases for Clinical Variant Interpretation in Cancer: A Case Study of MDS/AML	Variant interpretation; mutation databases; somatic variants in cancer	Background: Recently, guidelines for variant interpretation in cancer have been established. However, these guidelines do not mention which databases are most suited to performing this task. Materials and Methods: We give an overview of existing databases and evaluate their benefit in practical application. We compared three meta-databases and 12 databases for a dataset of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Results: Clinical implications were found for 13% of all variants. One-third of variants with therapeutic implications were uniquely contained in one database. The VICC meta-database was the most extensive source of information, featuring 92% of variants with a drug association. However, a comparison of meta-databases and original sources indicated that some variants are missing in those meta-databases. Conclusion: Public databases provide decision support for interpreting variants but there is still need for manual curation. Meta-databases facilitate the use of multiple resources but should be interpreted with caution.	10.21873/cgp.20250	Banck, Henrik; Dugas, Martin; Mueller-Tidow, Carsten; Sandmann, Sarah				J		CANCER GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS	English	Article				[Banck, Henrik; Dugas, Martin; Sandmann, Sarah] Univ Munster, Inst Med Informat, Albert Schweitzer Campus 1,Bldg A11, Munster, Germany; [Mueller-Tidow, Carsten] Univ Hosp Heidelberg, Abt Innere Med 5, Med Klin, Heidelberg, Germany		34.0	0.0	INT INST ANTICANCER RESEARCH	ATHENS	EDITORIAL OFFICE 1ST KM KAPANDRITIOU-KALAMOU RD KAPANDRITI, PO BOX 22, ATHENS 19014, GREECE	1109-6535		2021.0	18.0	2	157.0	166.0	10.21873/cgp.20250	WOS:000628915300007	33608312.0	44958	a=opendata	m=other	d=med	t=none	geo=all	Not sure if this should be included	a=opendata AND a=opentools	m=biblio AND m=other	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3066	WoS	Comparison of subscription access and open access obstetrics and gynecology journals in the SCImago database	open access journal; impact factor; subscription access journal; SCImago; obstetrics; gynecology	Objectives: The aim of this study is to compare the annual SJR and to evaluate the other parameters that show the sci-entific effect of journals in terms of open access (OA) or subscription access (SA) in the field of obstetrics and gynecology according to the SCImago database.Material and methods: This study was conducted between September-December 2019 at Near East University. The SCImago Journal & Country Rank database was used to collect information about the journals. We evaluated and compared the changes in the one-year SJR (SCImago Journal Rank) and journal impact factor (JIF) of OA and SA journals.Results: Data from 183 scientific journals in the field of obstetrics and gynecology from the period between 1999 and 2018 were evaluated, where 140 of these journals were SA and 43 were OA. The average SJR of OA journals in 1999 was 0.17, while it was 0.38 for SA journals. In 2018, these values were 0.31 and 0.78 for OA and SA journals, respectively. In the comparison of JIF, the average of the OA journals in 1999 was 0.09, while it was 0.66 for SA journals. In 2018, these values were 0.80 and 1.93 for OA and SA journals, respectively. Conclusions:Access to information has become easier due to technological developments and this will continue to affect the access policies of journals. Despite the disadvantages of predator journals, the rise of OA journals in terms of number and quality is likely to continue.	10.5603/GP.a2021.012	Ozay, AC; Ozay, OE; Gun, I																					2022.0					10.5603/GP.a2021.012			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=med	t=none	geo=all							
3074	Scopus	Content analysis and opinion mining of tweets about open access and its main features		This study aimed to identify the main features of Open Access tweeted by Twitter users and to analyze their opinions about them. A sample of English tweets about Open Access was identified and analyzed using a quantitative content analysis method with opinion mining approach. To do so, based on a wide literature review, the main features of Open Access discussed in the literature were identified and used to compose the search formula. This step retrieved 874270 tweets. The data were, then, cleaned using exact match search in Excel, resulting in a sample consisting of 165320 relevant tweets. The sample was, then, classified into four thematic groups including “costs and financial resources”, “publication and resources”, “models” and “validity and quality”. To analyze the tweets’ contents and calculate their opinion scores, the KNIME and SentiStrength applications were used, respectively. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics in Excel and SPSS. The results showed that the concepts related to the Open Access “publication and resources” have been tweeted the most. The group being set aside given its all-inclusive nature, the “credibility and quality” as well as the “costs and financial resources” are the two main issues discussed by Twitter users. According to the opinion mining results, more than half of the tweets were neutral and the positive opinions are of slightly higher frequency compared to the negative ones. The “credibility and quality” and the “costs and financial resources” received more negative tweets. Thus, in line with previous surveys conducted to explore the concerns of researchers and stakeholders about Open Access, the present study provided an almost similar picture for the social space. Since Open Access to scientific information is a necessity for the development of knowledge-based societies, the results highlight the need to take serious steps to strengthen its positive points and devise solutions to the problems and challenges leading to the negative feedbacks. © 2021 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

3075	WoS	Contribution of the Open Access Modality to the Impact of Hybrid Journals Controlling by Field and Time Effects	Open access; Open science; Scholarly communication; Hybrid journals; Citation advantage	Purpose: Researchers are more likely to read and cite papers to which they have access than those that they cannot obtain. Thus, the objective of this work is to analyze the contribution of the Open Access (OA) modality to the impact of hybrid journals. Design/methodology/approach: The research articles in the year 2017 from 200 hybrid journals in four subject areas, and the citations received by such articles in the period 2017-2020 in the Scopus database, were analyzed. The hybrid OA papers were compared with the paywalled ones. The journals were randomly selected from those with share of OA papers higher than some minimal value. More than 60 thousand research articles were analyzed in the sample, of which 24% under the OA modality. Findings: We obtain at journal level that cites per article in both hybrid modalities (OA and pay walled) strongly correlate. However, there is no correlation between the OA prevalence and cites per article. There is OA citation advantage in 80% of hybrid journals. Moreover, the OA citation advantage is consistent across fields and held in time. We obtain an OA citation advantage of 50% in average, and higher than 37% in half of the hybrid journals. Finally, the OA citation advantage is higher in Humanities than in Science and Social Science. Research limitations: Some of the citation advantage is likely due to more access allows more people to read and hence cite articles they otherwise would not. However, causation is difficult to establish and there are many possible bias. Several factors can affect the observed differences in citation rates. Funder mandates can be one of them. Funders are likely to have OA requirement, and well-funded studies are more likely to receive more citations than poorly funded studies. Another discussed factor is the selection bias postulate, which suggests that authors choose only their most impactful studies to be open access. Practical implications: For hybrid journals, the open access modality is positive, in the sense that it provides a greater number of potential readers. This in turn translates into a greater number of citations and an improvement in the position of the journal in the rankings by impact factor. For researchers it is also positive because it increases the potential number of readers and citations received. Originality/value: Our study refines previous results by comparing documents more similar to each other. Although it does not examine the cause of the observed citation advantage, we find that it exists in a very large sample.	10.2478/jdis-2022-0007	Dorta-Gonzalez, P; Dorta-Gonzalez, MI																					2022.0					10.2478/jdis-2022-0007			44958	a=openaccess	m=biblio	d=none	t=none	geo=all		a=openaccess AND a=openevaluation	m=biblio	d=natscie AND AND d=med AND AND d=socscie AND d=hum	t=none	geo=all							
3447	WoS	Open Science to the perspective of brazilian specialists: taxonomy proposal	Open Science - Taxonomy; Scientific Collaboration; Scientific Communication; e-Science; Open access; Open data; Open education; Citizen science; Digital preservation; Open innovation	Objective: This study aims to contextualize Open Science by proposing a Brazilian version of the taxonomy originally developed by the Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research (Foster) group, present in the Open Science project of the Community Research and Innovation Program, entitled Horizon 2020. Method: Bibliographic review, document review, descriptive and deductive approach research was adopted, with procedures of the Delphi method. Bibliographic research was used in order to retrieve documents that could contribute to the concept of the term Open Science, in a base of documents added in the Mendeley reference manager. We recovered 158 records and chose to present the concept mentioned in 13 of them, considering the best ranks and the number of users who added them in their Mendeley libraries or observed the context of the publication and this study. The second stage of the research involved the translation and expansion of taxonomy using the Delphi method. Bringing together 13 researchers specializing in the subject of Open Science in general or in some of its facets, who cooperated in the proposal to include new terms of taxonomy, as well as the validation and suggestions of new resources and concepts in the free translation initially performed. Results: For the first stage, the result of the definitions presents aspects of the Open Science ecosystem involving philosophical, scientific, social, technological, political and economic particularities. The second result of this research presents the proposal to incorporate new terms, composing a taxonomy with 11 facets and 82 labels in taxonomy. Conclusions: There is a transitory moment of transformation in scientific communication, involving the emergence of new movements related to science and the strengthening of an infrastructure that goes beyond the technology used, which certainly can be noted in the proposal of taxonomy built in collaboration with researchers and experts who work with Open Science or some of its facets.	10.5007/1518-2924.2022.e86251	Da Silveira, L; Ribeiro, NC; Santos, SRD; Silva, FMD; da Silva, FCC; Caregnato, SE; de Oliveira, ACS; Oliveira, DA; Garcia, JCR; Araujo, RF																					2022.0					10.5007/1518-2924.2022.e86251			44958	a=openscience	m=document review; m=interview	d=none	t=researcher; t=none	geo=BRZ	delphi-method translated as m=interview
